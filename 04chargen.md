Character Generation
====================

Characteristics
---------------

Every person and creature in Traveller has several characteristics that describe their base mental and physical potential.

Strength (Str)
: A character’s physical strength, fitness and forcefulness.

Dexterity (Dex)
: Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes.

Endurance (End)
: A character’s ability to sustain damage, stamina and determination.

Intelligence (Int)
: A character’s intellect and quickness of mind.

Education (Edu)
: A measure of a character’s learning and experience.

Social Standing (Soc)
: A character’s place in society.

Skills
------

If a character has no level in a skill, then she is untrained and will suffer a -3DM when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then she is competent in using that skill, but has little experience. She does not get any bonus from her skill ranks when using that skill but at least she avoids the penalty for being untrained.

If a character has one or more level in a skill (Level 1, Level 2, and so on) then she is trained in that skill. Each rank represents several years of experience using that skill. A character with Level 2-3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that field.

Some skills have specialities – specialised forms of that skill. A character picks a speciality when he gains level 1 in a skill with specialities. For example, a character might have Engineer 0, allowing him to make any Engineer skill checks without an unskilled penalty. She might then gain a level in Engineer, giving her Engineer (Jump drives) 1. She would make all Engineer checks involving Jump drives at a +1 DM, but would make all other Engineer checks at a +0 DM. A character can have multiple specialities in a skill – an engineer might have Engineer (aether drives) 1 and Engineer (power plant) 2. She would make checks related to aether drives with a +1 DM, checks related to power plants with a +2 DM and all other Engineer checks with a +0 DM.

### Background Skills

Before embarking on your careers, your character gets a number of background skills equal to 3 + her Education DM (1 to 5, depending on your Education score).

#### Homeworld

Growing up on your homeworld gave you skills that depend on the planet’s nature. You can select any skill that matches your homeworld’s planetary description and trade codes. If you came from a planet already established, then consult those sources for the planet’s description.

#### Education

A formal education gives you a basic level of competence in various sciences and academic disciplines. Any character may choose from the following list:

Admin 0, Advocate 0, Art 0, Carouse 0, Comms 0, Computer 0, Drive 0, Engineer 0, Language 0, Medic 0, Physical Science 0, Life Science 0, Social Science 0, Space Science 0, Trade 0.

Careers
-------

At many points during a career, a character will have to make a throw of some sort. Most of these throws are characteristic throws – roll 2d6, add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total higher than the listed value. A throw of Int 8+ means ‘roll 2d6, add your Intelligence DM, and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more’. A few throws are skill checks, where you add any levels in that skill and the DM from an appropriate characteristic. For example, a throw of Gunnery 8+ would mean ‘roll 2d6, add your Gunnery skill and the DM from an appropriate characteristic such as Dexterity, and get over 8’.

### Career Format

Qualification
: What you need to roll to enter that career. Military careers use Enlistment as the description for this roll instead of qualification. If you fail this check then you cannot enter your chosen career this term. You must either submit to the Draft or take the Drifter career for this term. You suffer a –1 DM to qualification rolls for each previous career you have entered. Once you leave a career you cannot return to it. The Draft and the Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into a career you were previously in but got ejected from and the Drifter career is always open.

Skills and Training
: Each career has skill tables associated with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Specialist Skills and Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1d6 to see which skill you increase. You may only roll on Advanced Skills if your character has the listed qualification (usually Education 8+ or a certain Rank). You may only roll on the Officer Skills if your career has one and if you have received a commission.
: Skills can be listed with or without an associated level. If no rank is listed, then you gain that skill at Level 1 if you do not have it already, or increases its level by one if you are already trained in that field. If a rank is listed, then you gain the skill at that level as long as it is better than your current level in that skill.

#### Basic Training

For your first career only, you get all the skills listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. For any subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training.

#### Survival

Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, roll on the mishap table. This mishap is always enough to force you to leave the service. You lose the benefit roll for the current term only. A natural 2 is always a failure.

#### Events

If you are still in your career after resolving the survival roll, roll on the events table to see what interesting things befall you this term.

#### Commission

This only applies to the military careers of Army, Navy and Marines. A character who succeeds at a commission roll becomes a Rank 1 officer in that career, and uses the officer Rank table from then on. A character may attempt a commission roll once per term, and trying for commission is optional.

If you obtain a commission after having already advanced several ranks, you become a Rank 1 officer as normal but you may add your two final ranks together for the purposes of determining benefits and pensions.

Some events give a bonus DM to advancement rolls, or give automatic advancement. You can apply these DMs to commission rolls also.

#### Advancement

Each career has an advancement roll.

If you make a successful Advancement roll, then you move to the next rank and gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and Training Tables for this career. You also get any benefits listed for your new rank. You may only attempt to advance once per term.

If your result is equal to or less than the number of terms you have spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and want a new challenge.

If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career.

#### Ranks and Benefits

You start at Rank 0 in your career. Each time you succeed at an advancement check, you move onto the next Rank.

Some ranks have benefits associated with them, such as extra skills or more benefits. You gain these benefits as soon as you attain that rank.

#### Mustering-Out Benefits

When you leave a career for any reason, you gain material benefits from that career. There are two tables – Cash and Benefits. You may only roll on the cash tables a maximum of three times, regardless of how many careers or benefit rolls you have. You get one benefit roll per full term served. Leaving due to a mishap means you lose the benefit roll for that term, but not previous full terms in that career.

If you reached rank 1 or 2, you get an extra benefit roll when leaving that service. If you reached rank 3 or 4, you get two extra benefit rolls, and if you reached rank 5 or 6, you get three extra benefit rolls and may apply a +1 to rolls on the Benefits table that you gain from that career.

  12  You discover a world, item or information of worth to the CoreWorlds. You are automatically promoted.

-----------------------------------------------------------


### Drifters and The Draft

You may attempt to enlist in one career each term if you are not continuing on in an existing career. If you fail to for a new career, you have two options. You can apply to the Draft and be randomly sent to one of the military services or you may spend that term travelling through known space as a Drifter without a career or purpose. A character may only enter the Draft once.

#### Draft Table

| 1d6 | Career (speciality)         |
|:---:|:----------------------------|
|  1  | Navy (any)                  |
|  2  | Army (any)                  |
|  3  | Marines (any)               |
|  4  | Merchants (merchant marine) |
|  5  | Scouts (any)                |
|  6  | Agent (law enforcement)     |

### Life Events

If you roll a Life Event on the Events table for your career, roll on the Life Events table.

### Mustering Out Benefits

Benefits are gained when a character leaves a career for any reason other than failing a survival roll.

You may only roll on the Cash table a maximum of three times no matter how many careers you have had.

#### Cash Benefits

A character with the Gambler skill at level 1 or better gets a +1 DM to all rolls on the Cash table.

If the character has any money after rolling on the Cash table then he may purchase personal equipment worth up to 2,000 credits immediately.

#### Other Benefits

When you leave a career in good standing with your previous employers, you are permitted to keep various pieces of equipment or even shares of a vessel.

#### Retirement Pay

A character that leaves a service at the end of the 5^th^ or later term of service may receive retirement pay.

 Terms | Pay
:-----:|:-------------------------
   5   | Cr. 10,000
   6   | Cr. 12,000
   7   | Cr. 14,000
   8   | Cr. 16,000
   9+  | +2,000 per term beyond 8

### Ageing

The effects of ageing begin when a character reaches 1GSec of age. At the end of the fourth term, and at the end of every term thereafter, the character must roll 2d6 on the Ageing Table. Apply the character’s total number of terms as a negative Dice Modifier on this table.

#### Ageing Crisis

If any characteristic is reduced to 0 by ageing, then the character suffers an ageing crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6 x 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms.

#### Anagathics

While using anagathic drugs, the character effectively does not age – add the number of terms since the character started taking anagathics as a positive Dice Modifier to rolls on the ageing table. If a character stops taking anagathics, then he must roll immediately on the ageing table to simulate the shock that comes from his system beginning to age again.

The risk of trying to obtain a reliable supply and the disruption to the character’s biochemistry means the character must make a second Survival check if he passes his first Survival check in a term. If either check is failed, the character suffers a mishap and is ejected from the career.

The drugs cost 1d6 x 2,500 Credits for each term that the character uses the drugs. These costs are paid out of the character’s eventual mustering-out cash benefits. If the character cannot pay these bills, he goes into debt.

### Injuries

Characters that are wounded in combat or accidents during character creation must roll on the Injury table.

#### Injury Table

----------------------------------------------------------
 1d6  Injury
----- ----------------------------------------------------
  1   Nearly killed. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6, reduce both other physical characteristics by 2 (or one of them by 4).

  2   Severely injured. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6.

  3   Missing eye or limb. Reduce Strength or Dexterity by 2.

  4   Scarred. You are scarred and injured. Reduce any one physical characteristic by 2.

  5   Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1.

  6   Lightly injured. No permanent effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------

#### Injury Crisis

If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the character suffers an injury crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6 x 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms.

#### Medical Care

If your character has been injured, then medical care may be able to undo the effects of damage. The restoration of a lost characteristic costs 5,000 Credits per point.

If your character was injured in the service of a patron or organisation, then a portion of his medical care may be paid for by that patron. Roll 2d6 on the table below, adding your Rank as a DM. The result is how much of his medical care is paid for by his employer.

##### Medical Bills

--------------------------------------------------------------
 Career                 Roll of 4+   Roll of 8+   Roll of 12+
---------------------- ------------ ------------ -------------
 Military                   75%         100%          100% 

 Civilian                   50%          75%          100%

 Freelancer                  0%          50%           75%

--------------------------------------------------------------

### Medical Debt

During finishing touches, you must pay any outstanding costs from medical care or anagathic drugs out of your Benefits before anything else.

### Finalise Connections

The connections between characters rule can give you bonus skills. At this stage, you may make (or finalise) a connection between your character and up to two other player characters. For each connection you make, you may gain one level in any skill, but you cannot bring a skill above level 3 using this rule nor may you take the Jack of all Trades skill.

Creating a Navy Character
-------------------------

### Naval College 

If a character attends naval college, he spends four years there preparing for his career in the navy. To enter naval college, the character must pass the Entry roll. If successful, he may choose a course and attempt to pass the course in order to gain its benefits. A failed course after gaining entry means the character flunks out and spends his first term in the drifter career.

No character may attempt to enter Naval College after his first term, the Navy has plenty of potential recruits eager to fill their ranks and never wish to be seen as the second choice for any new officer recruit.

Any graduate from a Naval College will be commissioned and immediately start his first term at rank o1. A successful education at Naval College will leave the new officer with a full set of basic skills, some training in his chosen specialist field and, of course, his commission as an officer. He will not have an Event or Mishap, losing any benefits he may have gained. In addition he will not gain a mustering out benefit for the term he spent in college.

A graduate will not immediately be placed within his specialised service, instead serving in the Crewman role of the navy of his choice (it is fairly uncommon, but not unknown, for promising graduates to opt for a naval career in their own planetary navy rather than the more prestigious TransPow Fleet, for example).

A character that fails admission to one of the Naval Colleges is able to then attempt to join a career of his choice and does not enter the draft.

If admitted the new midshipman undergoes a series of tests over the course of his term. If he succeeds he is deemed to have passed out of the college with a commission, basic training for his chosen field and can roll on the service skills table for the assignment of his choice.

If the character succeeds in making her honours roll, instead of rolling on the service skills table she is free to choose the skill of her choice from that table.

### Expanded Character Generation & Ranks

Not all ranks are available in all careers. Obviously, a legendary commander is going to be at least of a rank where they will have a command. A character who is not of the minimum rank number or above the maximum rank for a career suffers a –1DM per missing rank number when trying to qualify for that career. If a character qualifies for a career when he is below the minimum rank, he is promoted to that rank.

Some careers are only available to commissioned characters.

For the purposes of benefits ranks o1 to o3 are the equivalent to ranks 1 to 3 respectively in the main Traveller rulebook, ranks o4 and o5 are the equivalent to rank 4, ranks 06 and o7 to rank 5, and ranks o8 and above to rank 6.

| Rank | NCO                     | Rank | Commissioned  |
|:----:|:------------------------|:----:|:--------------|
| E1   | Spacehand Recruit       |  O1  | Ensign        |
| E2   | Spacehand Apprentice    |  O2  | Sublieutenant |
| E3   | Able Spacehand          |  O3  | Lieutenant    |
| E4   | Petty Officer 3rd Class |  O4  | Lt Commander  |
| E5   | Petty Officer 2nd Class |  O5  | Commander     |
| E6   | Petty Officer 1st Class |  O6  | Captain       |
| E7   | Chief Petty Officer     |  O7  | Commodore     |
| E8   | Sr Chief Petty Officer  |  O8  | Fleet Admiral |
| E9   | Master Chief            |  O9  | Sector Admiral |
|      |                         | O10  | Grand Admiral |


#### Navy Type

A character who leaves a planetary navy to join the TransPow Fleet drops back down to rank 0.

A character ejected from the Fleet or an ætherspace navy through mishap cannot reenlist in either the Fleet or that particular ætherspace navy. A character ejected from any career may attempt to join the planetary navy again, but may join a maximum of three different planetary navies.

### Medals and Commendations

These medals are awarded during character generation whenever the character is involved in a Mishap or Event that is combat orientated and needs a skill roll to prevent injury. The result of this roll will determine what medal(s) are received by the character.

Combat Ribbon
: Any character that is in a combat Event or Mishap will automatically be awarded a Combat Ribbon.

Combat Command Ribbon
: Any officer that receives a Combat Ribbon is automatically awarded with a Combat Command Ribbon.

Purple Heart
: Any character that has to roll on the injury table having failed their skill roll is awarded a Purple Heart.

Meritorious Conduct under Fire (MCUF)
: A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of their skill roll is 3 or more.

Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry (MCG)
: A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of their Difficult (-2) skill roll is 5 or more.

Starburst for Extreme Heroism (SEH)
: A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of their Very Difficult (-4) skill roll is 6 or more.

Long Service Medal
: Any character that serves five or more terms in any Navy automatically receives the Long Service medal.

Meritorious Performance of Duties Medal
: Whenever a character needs to roll a skill on their events table and rolls a natural 12 they are deemed to have impressed their superiors enough during that term to be made a recipient of this award.


#### Medal Benefits

A character who wins a medal may apply a DM from that medal to any one Survival, Qualification or Promotion roll. The DM from a medal may only be applied once.

| Medal                             | DM |
|:----------------------------------|:--:|
| Purple Heart                      | +1 |
| Meritorious Conduct Under Fire    | +2 |
| Meritorious Performance Of Duties | +1 |
| Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry   | +3 |
| Starburst for Extreme Heroism     | +4 |
| Long Service                      | +1 |

When a character is mustering out, any medal DMs left unused may be converted into extra benefit rolls, at the rate of one roll per 2 DMs left unused, rounding down.

#### Going for Glory

A character may add up to 3 to the difficulty of the skill roll, making it much more likely to be injured. However, when it comes to receiving an award the modifier is added to the Effect instead.

### Crewman

The bulk of the crew on board any naval vessel are low–ranking crewmen, serving under more senior officers. Unlike other careers, the crewman career is divided not by specialisation, but by the type of the navy. Planetary navies are small–scale affairs, normally only a handful of pirate hunter and customs ships or system defence boats. Subsector navies provide local defence and patrol aetherspace around a number of systems. The CoreWorlds Fleet is the most prestigious assignment, but also the most dangerous.

#### Assignments

Choose one of the following:

* Planetary Navy: You served in one of the hundreds of local naval forces across known space.
* Ætherspace Navy: You served in an aetherspace navy under the seal of some group of star systems, battling pirates and protecting trade routes.
* TransPow Fleet: You served upon a major warship, watching for incursions by foreign powers.

#### Qualifications:

* Planetary Navy – Int +3
* Aetherspace Navy – Int +2
* TransPow Fleet – Int +1

If you are aged 1GSec or more: –2 DM

Per previous career: –1 DM
