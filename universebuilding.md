# Space Travel

There are different forms of æther travel, all of which get around the lightspeed barrier. This makes them all weird, and fantastical. One of the great differences of the CoreWorlds and their renaissance has been the diffusion of philosophical, magical, outside of physical world knowledge. This is a universe of metaphysics and one that has been created and maintained with that in mind. This is not because of any one creator - there are no gods who made things one way and not another - there are only the actions of individuals which coalesce into creating the universe as it is.

## History

At some point thousands of years ago humanity had a pretty good handle on how to transform fundamental building blocks of matter into useful forms. The unbreakable lightspeed barrier and the time it would take and the radiation and just general fuckery of dealing with interstellar relativistic travel meant that sending fleshy sacks of carbon to other stars for the possibility of setting human flesh on a new frontier made that a non-starter (of course there were wackos, willing to load up colony ships filled with meatbags in freezers to give it a shot).

### Seedphase

What made more sense to the people of that time (many of whom were spending more time in virtual spaces anyway) was to transmit information on how to reassemble a certain level of technology and biology and just put it out there. It would be slow in comparison to hopping onto a plane and getting somewhere, but the information would be out there.

Now, the technology wasn't quite at the point where you could transmit a code at an asteroid and it would spontaneously turn into a human factory, so they sent very small satellites, little seeds at sublight speeds and they sent them everywhere. These seeds would be able to take the information they were broadcasting and reassemble something approximating life in the places it got to.

The seeds were small and ran programs with whole virtual societies running on them. Each one debated as they approached stars about how to deploy their resources and most decided to set up in systems. They had plans for how to create entities and societies and they were able to harvest information being sent along more quickly from home. Decisions were made and vast chunks of the galaxy was seeded.

Because of the lightspeed barrier there was little travel between these seeded systems. Not only would it take ages to get between them (which wasn't necessarily a terrible thing if most of your entities were non biological) but most entities were happy to do their own experiments in the places they were. There was a bit of room to see how constant expansion might not make any of the issues individuals faced any more surmountable. Communities were scattered among the stars, talking to each other with comfortable delays. Quantum entanglement communicators were often exchanged, more as an interesting project than for any need to communicate faster. If there were major catastrophes in the works they were broken out, but mostly it was an emergency beacon.

### The cult of flesh

The cult of flesh grew up through communication between a number of worlds that had relatively carbon-friendly environments and who had put their factories to work creating biological beings, usually in the shape of the human ancestors. This newly re-biologized version of humanity was very interested in many things, but possibly the most momentous was the notion of other biologies.

Through communion with other biological entities that inhabited dimensions unknown to the seed civilization, the higher dimensions were opened up breaking a whole host of technological barriers. One of these dimensions was ætherspace.

Through the æther, faster than light travel was now possible. The cult of flesh retook the ancient name of humanity and set out to conquer the stars.

### beacons in the night

Humanity now had many shapes and forms that it was using to travel among the stars. They learned quite quickly about the dangers inherent in the higher dimensions and worked diligently to make them work for them rather than against. One of the early keys was to use the quantum entanglement communicators that were part of the seedphase as the signposts for navigation. 

The Æther was a strange place; it didn't behave like normal space where the things that would kill you were hard radiation and cosmic rays. You also had large issues in communicating with normal space and definitely couldn't see anything that was happening in it when you were in the æther. Except for the QE beacons.

These became the guideposts for the new onslaught of humanity. Most of them were the sites of moderately happy communities, but since they were what was visible to the fleshy beings travelling at such incredible speed they were immediately overwhelmed. The biologicals were happy to destroy or repurpose the factories in systems, ready to use the machines to build fleshy beings primed and ready to inhabit the systems. In many cases the Seedphase inhabitants were left alone as the systems they inhabited weren't directly useful to the biologicals. Some of the Seedcivs began re-editing their depictions of their situations so as not to attract humanity's attention.

In this time, as in many, it was slightly unclear what anyone wanted. Humanity was pouring out to the stars often at random, sometimes in the company of terrifying creatures they'd met in the æther. Many of those creatures had specific desires for resources found only circling certain types of stars, and they were usually not as adept at manipulating matter as the reassmbling machines of the seedcivs were. Humanity was working hard at biological manipulation and left deep physics mostly alone. There was so much power to be had in the new alien powers of the mind. 

### rise of the coreworlds

People wanted places to live and let live without the notion of FTL biological cousins bursting into a star system and raining rocks on your world. As the expansion and genocide began to cool down a sober second thought kind of organization began to arise. It took a long time but eventually, using the quantum entanglement communicators something approaching an interstellar civilization was established. It was mostly a loose federation, and left the most rapacious servitude of the higherdimensional beasts behind it.

The core worlds maturity truly began with the ætheric tunnel. Now people could go through the void at FTL speeds without needing to rely on Ætheric navigators and pilots. FTL could be systematized, and it connected systems. The expansion of this network continues today into Sector EDG.
