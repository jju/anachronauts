Die Roll Conventions
====================

Check (or Throw)
: To determine if a character succeeds or fails at a particular task, the player must make a check. To make a check, the player rolls 2d6 and adds any appropriate Dice Modifiers (such as a skill her character possesses, or a bonus from a piece of equipment). If the total is equal to or greater than the target number for that check, she succeeds. A check will usually have a skill or characteristic associated with it. For example, a check of ‘Dex 8+’ means ‘roll 2d6, add your Dexterity Characteristic Modifier, and you succeed if you have a total result of 8 or more’.

Target Numbers
: In many checks, the player needs to roll equal to or above a specific number (usually, eight or more). This is denoted by a number followed by a plus, such as 8+.
: In Anachronauts the Target Number is always 8+ and difficulties are expressed as DMs.

Dice Modifier (DM)
: A number to be applied to a die roll before it is used. Dice Modifiers are preceded by a sign, which indicates if the number is to be added to or subtracted from the roll. For example, a Dice Modifier of -2 indicates that two is to be subtracted from the roll; a Die Modifier of +4 indicates that four is to be added to the roll.

[^1]: See the Tasks section for more on DMs.

Difficulty     | DM |
:--------------|:--:|
Simple         | +6 |
Easy           | +4 |
Routine        | +2 |
Challenging    | +0 |
Difficult      | -2 |
Very Difficult | -4 |
Formidable     | -6 |

> Unless otherwise noted a modified roll of 8+ is a *costly* success, and a modified roll of 12+ is a *flawless* success.
>
> On a costly success use the highest die for the Timing and the lowest die for the Effect.
>
> On a flawless success use the highest die for the Effect and the lowest die for the Timing.

Technology Levels
=================

Technology Levels measure the scientific-industrial capacity of a world and the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment.

TL 0
: Nothing obviously created but clever uses of the natural environment are common.

TL 1
: Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology. Writing is developed.

TL 2
: Warring States technology. Block printing.

TL 3
: (Nonindustrial) The advances of TL 2 are now applied, bringing the germ of industrial revolution and steam power. Wood and metal are still the main construction materials. Moveable Type. Debt.

TL 4
: (Industrial) Construction can now involve plastics, radio and industrial revolution inventions.

TL 5
: (Industrial) Widespread electrification, tele-communications and internal combustion if in a fossil-fuel rich environment.

TL 6
: (Industrial) TL 6 brings the development of fission power and microchip computing.

TL 7
: (Modern) A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and has telecommunications satellites.

TL 8
: (Late Modern) At TL 8, it is possible to reach other worlds in the same system, although terraforming or full colonisation are not within the culture’s capacity. Computers, lasers, miniaturization and mature nuclear fission technology all exists.

TL 9
: (Information) The defining element of TL 9 is the development of vast information networks on a planetary scale. Aetherhooks can be created with the proper materials and supplications (though historically they were not).

TL 10
: (Microscience) With the advent of cryogenics and mechanical/cyborg assists, lifespans are extended virtually and nearby systems are opened up. AI is an actual thing, fusion technology is coming into being as are more useful robots.

TL 11
: (Transhuman) The first sapient artificial intelligences become possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. Fusion technology is maturing, antimatter is being theoretically understood.

TL 12
: (Geoengineering) Weather control revolutionises terraforming and agriculture.

TL 13
: (Seedphase) Matter transmogrification nanotechnology is mature and allows for massive rewriting of physical reality.

TL 14
: (Cult of Flesh) Fusion weapons and vast destructive arrays available. (Historically "humanity" was at this TL when the discovery of ætherspace went mainstream.)

TL 15
: (High Stellar) Aetherdrives developed, bringing FTL to those who don't want to make pacts with dark powers.


Character Generation
====================

Characteristics
---------------

Every person and creature in Traveller has several characteristics that describe their base mental and physical potential.

Strength (Str)
: A character’s physical strength, fitness and forcefulness.

Dexterity (Dex)
: Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes.

Endurance (End)
: A character’s ability to sustain damage, stamina and determination.

Intelligence (Int)
: A character’s intellect and quickness of mind.

Education (Edu)
: A measure of a character’s learning and experience.

Social Standing (Soc)
: A character’s place in society.

Skills
------

If a character has no level in a skill, then she is untrained and will suffer a -3DM when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then she is competent in using that skill, but has little experience. She does not get any bonus from her skill ranks when using that skill but at least she avoids the penalty for being untrained.

If a character has one or more level in a skill (Level 1, Level 2, and so on) then she is trained in that skill. Each rank represents several years of experience using that skill. A character with Level 2-3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that field.

Some skills have specialities – specialised forms of that skill. A character picks a speciality when he gains level 1 in a skill with specialities. For example, a character might have Engineer 0, allowing him to make any Engineer skill checks without an unskilled penalty. She might then gain a level in Engineer, giving her Engineer (Jump drives) 1. She would make all Engineer checks involving Jump drives at a +1 DM, but would make all other Engineer checks at a +0 DM. A character can have multiple specialities in a skill – an engineer might have Engineer (aether drives) 1 and Engineer (power plant) 2. She would make checks related to aether drives with a +1 DM, checks related to power plants with a +2 DM and all other Engineer checks with a +0 DM.

### Background Skills

Before embarking on your careers, your character gets a number of background skills equal to 3 + her Education DM (1 to 5, depending on your Education score).

#### Homeworld

Growing up on your homeworld gave you skills that depend on the planet’s nature. You can select any skill that matches your homeworld’s planetary description and trade codes. If you came from a planet already established, then consult those sources for the planet’s description.

#### Education

A formal education gives you a basic level of competence in various sciences and academic disciplines. Any character may choose from the following list:

Admin 0, Advocate 0, Art 0, Carouse 0, Comms 0, Computer 0, Drive 0, Engineer 0, Language 0, Medic 0, Physical Science 0, Life Science 0, Social Science 0, Space Science 0, Trade 0.

Careers
-------

At many points during a career, a character will have to make a throw of some sort. Most of these throws are characteristic throws – roll 2d6, add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total higher than the listed value. A throw of Int 8+ means ‘roll 2d6, add your Intelligence DM, and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more’. A few throws are skill checks, where you add any levels in that skill and the DM from an appropriate characteristic. For example, a throw of Gunnery 8+ would mean ‘roll 2d6, add your Gunnery skill and the DM from an appropriate characteristic such as Dexterity, and get over 8’.

### Career Format

Qualification
: What you need to roll to enter that career. Military careers use Enlistment as the description for this roll instead of qualification. If you fail this check then you cannot enter your chosen career this term. You must either submit to the Draft or take the Drifter career for this term. You suffer a –1 DM to qualification rolls for each previous career you have entered. Once you leave a career you cannot return to it. The Draft and the Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into a career you were previously in but got ejected from and the Drifter career is always open.

Skills and Training
: Each career has skill tables associated with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Specialist Skills and Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1d6 to see which skill you increase. You may only roll on Advanced Skills if your character has the listed qualification (usually Education 8+ or a certain Rank). You may only roll on the Officer Skills if your career has one and if you have received a commission.
: Skills can be listed with or without an associated level. If no rank is listed, then you gain that skill at Level 1 if you do not have it already, or increases its level by one if you are already trained in that field. If a rank is listed, then you gain the skill at that level as long as it is better than your current level in that skill.

#### Basic Training

For your first career only, you get all the skills listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. For any subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training.

#### Survival

Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, roll on the mishap table. This mishap is always enough to force you to leave the service. You lose the benefit roll for the current term only. A natural 2 is always a failure.

#### Events

If you are still in your career after resolving the survival roll, roll on the events table to see what interesting things befall you this term.

#### Commission

This only applies to the military careers of Army, Navy and Marines. A character who succeeds at a commission roll becomes a Rank 1 officer in that career, and uses the officer Rank table from then on. A character may attempt a commission roll once per term, and trying for commission is optional.

If you obtain a commission after having already advanced several ranks, you become a Rank 1 officer as normal but you may add your two final ranks together for the purposes of determining benefits and pensions.

Some events give a bonus DM to advancement rolls, or give automatic advancement. You can apply these DMs to commission rolls also.

#### Advancement

Each career has an advancement roll.

If you make a successful Advancement roll, then you move to the next rank and gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and Training Tables for this career. You also get any benefits listed for your new rank. You may only attempt to advance once per term.

If your result is equal to or less than the number of terms you have spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and want a new challenge.

If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career.

#### Ranks and Benefits

You start at Rank 0 in your career. Each time you succeed at an advancement check, you move onto the next Rank.

Some ranks have benefits associated with them, such as extra skills or more benefits. You gain these benefits as soon as you attain that rank.

#### Mustering-Out Benefits

When you leave a career for any reason, you gain material benefits from that career. There are two tables – Cash and Benefits. You may only roll on the cash tables a maximum of three times, regardless of how many careers or benefit rolls you have. You get one benefit roll per full term served. Leaving due to a mishap means you lose the benefit roll for that term, but not previous full terms in that career.

If you reached rank 1 or 2, you get an extra benefit roll when leaving that service. If you reached rank 3 or 4, you get two extra benefit rolls, and if you reached rank 5 or 6, you get three extra benefit rolls and may apply a +1 to rolls on the Benefits table that you gain from that career.

#### Mishaps

----------------------------------------------------------
 1d6  Mishap 
----- ----------------------------------------------------
  1   Severely injured in action. 
      (This is the same as a result of 2 on the Injury table.) Alternatively, roll twice on the Injury table (page 37) and take the lower result.

  2   Psychologically damaged by your time in the scouts. 
      Reduce your Intelligence or Social Standing by 1.

  3   Your ship is damaged, and you have to hitch-hike your way back across the stars to the nearest scout base.

 2d6  Events
----- -----------------------------------------------------
  2   Disaster! Roll on the mishap table, but you are not ejected from this career.

  3   Your ship is ambushed by enemy vessels. Either run, and throw Pilot 8+ to escape, or treat with them and throw Persuade 10+ to bargain with them. If you fail the check, then your ship is destroyed and you may not re-enlist in the Scouts at the end of this term. If you succeed, you survive and gain Sensors 1. Either way, gain an Enemy.

  4   You survey an alien world. Gain one of Animals (riding or training) 1, Survival 1, Recon 1 or Life Science (any) 1

  5   You perform an exemplary service for the scouts. Gain a +1 DM to any one Benefit roll.

  6   You spend several years jumping from world to world in your scout ship. Gain one of Astrogation 1, Navigation 1, Pilot (small craft) 1 or Mechanic 1.

  7   Life Event. Roll on the Life Events table.

  8   When dealing with an alien race, you have an opportunity to gather extra intelligence about them. Roll either Sensors 8+ or Deception 8+. If you succeed, gain an Ally in the CoreWorlds and a +2 DM to your next Advancement roll. If you fail, roll on the Mishap table, but you are not ejected from this career.

  9   Your scout ship is one of the first on the scene to rescue the survivors of a disaster. Roll either Medic 8+ or Engineer 8+. If you succeed, gain a Contact and a +2 DM to your next Advancement check. If you fail, gain an Enemy.

  10  You spend a great deal of time on the fringes of known space. Roll Survival 8+ or Pilot 8+. If you succeed, gain a Contact in an alien race and one level in any skill of your choice. If you fail, roll on the Mishap table.

  11  You serve as the courier for an important message from the CoreWorlds. Either gain one level of Diplomat, or take a +4 DM to your next Advancement roll.

  12  You discover a world, item or information of worth to the CoreWorlds. You are automatically promoted.

-----------------------------------------------------------


### Drifters and The Draft

You may attempt to enlist in one career each term if you are not continuing on in an existing career. If you fail to for a new career, you have two options. You can apply to the Draft and be randomly sent to one of the military services or you may spend that term travelling through known space as a Drifter without a career or purpose. A character may only enter the Draft once.

#### Draft Table

| 1d6 | Career (speciality)         |
|:---:|:----------------------------|
|  1  | Navy (any)                  |
|  2  | Army (any)                  |
|  3  | Marines (any)               |
|  4  | Merchants (merchant marine) |
|  5  | Scouts (any)                |
|  6  | Agent (law enforcement)     |

### Life Events

If you roll a Life Event on the Events table for your career, roll on the Life Events table.

### Mustering Out Benefits

Benefits are gained when a character leaves a career for any reason other than failing a survival roll.

You may only roll on the Cash table a maximum of three times no matter how many careers you have had.

#### Cash Benefits

A character with the Gambler skill at level 1 or better gets a +1 DM to all rolls on the Cash table.

If the character has any money after rolling on the Cash table then he may purchase personal equipment worth up to 2,000 credits immediately.

#### Other Benefits

When you leave a career in good standing with your previous employers, you are permitted to keep various pieces of equipment or even shares of a vessel.

#### Retirement Pay

A character that leaves a service at the end of the 5^th^ or later term of service may receive retirement pay.

 Terms | Pay
:-----:|:-------------------------
   5   | Cr. 10,000
   6   | Cr. 12,000
   7   | Cr. 14,000
   8   | Cr. 16,000
   9+  | +2,000 per term beyond 8

### Ageing

The effects of ageing begin when a character reaches 34 years of age. At the end of the fourth term, and at the end of every term thereafter, the character must roll 2d6 on the Ageing Table. Apply the character’s total number of terms as a negative Dice Modifier on this table.

#### Ageing Crisis

If any characteristic is reduced to 0 by ageing, then the character suffers an ageing crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6 x 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms.

#### Anagathics

While using anagathic drugs, the character effectively does not age – add the number of terms since the character started taking anagathics as a positive Dice Modifier to rolls on the ageing table. If a character stops taking anagathics, then he must roll immediately on the ageing table to simulate the shock that comes from his system beginning to age again.

The risk of trying to obtain a reliable supply and the disruption to the character’s biochemistry means the character must make a second Survival check if he passes his first Survival check in a term. If either check is failed, the character suffers a mishap and is ejected from the career.

The drugs cost 1d6 x 2,500 Credits for each term that the character uses the drugs. These costs are paid out of the character’s eventual mustering-out cash benefits. If the character cannot pay these bills, he goes into debt.

### Injuries

Characters that are wounded in combat or accidents during character creation must roll on the Injury table.

#### Injury Table

----------------------------------------------------------
 1d6  Injury
----- ----------------------------------------------------
  1   Nearly killed. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6, reduce both other physical characteristics by 2 (or one of them by 4).

  2   Severely injured. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6.

  3   Missing eye or limb. Reduce Strength or Dexterity by 2.

  4   Scarred. You are scarred and injured. Reduce any one physical characteristic by 2.

  5   Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1.

  6   Lightly injured. No permanent effect.

-----------------------------------------------------------

#### Injury Crisis

If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the character suffers an injury crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6 x 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualification checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms.

#### Medical Care

If your character has been injured, then medical care may be able to undo the effects of damage. The restoration of a lost characteristic costs 5,000 Credits per point.

If your character was injured in the service of a patron or organisation, then a portion of his medical care may be paid for by that patron. Roll 2d6 on the table below, adding your Rank as a DM. The result is how much of his medical care is paid for by his employer.

##### Medical Bills

--------------------------------------------------------------
 Career                 Roll of 4+   Roll of 8+   Roll of 12+
---------------------- ------------ ------------ -------------
 Military                   75%         100%          100% 

 Civilian                   50%          75%          100%

 Freelancer                  0%          50%           75%

--------------------------------------------------------------

### Medical Debt

During finishing touches, you must pay any outstanding costs from medical care or anagathic drugs out of your Benefits before anything else.

### Finalise Connections

The connections between characters rule can give you bonus skills. At this stage, you may make (or finalise) a connection between your character and up to two other player characters. For each connection you make, you may gain one level in any skill, but you cannot bring a skill above level 3 using this rule nor may you take the Jack of all Trades skill.

Creating a Navy Character
-------------------------

### Naval College 

If a character attends naval college, he spends four years there preparing for his career in the navy. To enter naval college, the character must pass the Entry roll. If successful, he may choose a course and attempt to pass the course in order to gain its benefits. A failed course after gaining entry means the character flunks out and spends his first term in the drifter career.

No character may attempt to enter Naval College after his first term, the Navy has plenty of potential recruits eager to fill their ranks and never wish to be seen as the second choice for any new officer recruit.

Any graduate from a Naval College will be commissioned and immediately start his first term at rank o1. A successful education at Naval College will leave the new officer with a full set of basic skills, some training in his chosen specialist field and, of course, his commission as an officer. He will not have an Event or Mishap, losing any benefits he may have gained. In addition he will not gain a mustering out benefit for the term he spent in college.

A graduate will not immediately be placed within his specialised service, instead serving in the Crewman role of the navy of his choice (it is fairly uncommon, but not unknown, for promising graduates to opt for a naval career in their own planetary navy rather than the more prestigious TransPow Fleet, for example).

A character that fails admission to one of the Naval Colleges is able to then attempt to join a career of his choice and does not enter the draft.

If admitted the new midshipman undergoes a series of tests over the course of his term. If he succeeds he is deemed to have passed out of the college with a commission, basic training for his chosen field and can roll on the service skills table for the assignment of his choice.

If the character succeeds in making her honours roll, instead of rolling on the service skills table she is free to choose the skill of her choice from that table.

### Expanded Character Generation & Ranks

Not all ranks are available in all careers. Obviously, a legendary commander is going to be at least of a rank where they will have a command. A character who is not of the minimum rank number or above the maximum rank for a career suffers a –1DM per missing rank number when trying to qualify for that career. If a character qualifies for a career when he is below the minimum rank, he is promoted to that rank.

Some careers are only available to commissioned characters.

For the purposes of benefits ranks o1 to o3 are the equivalent to ranks 1 to 3 respectively in the main Traveller rulebook, ranks o4 and o5 are the equivalent to rank 4, ranks 06 and o7 to rank 5, and ranks o8 and above to rank 6.

| Rank | NCO                     | Rank | Commissioned  |
|:----:|:------------------------|:----:|:--------------|
| E1   | Spacehand Recruit       |  O1  | Ensign        |
| E2   | Spacehand Apprentice    |  O2  | Sublieutenant |
| E3   | Able Spacehand          |  O3  | Lieutenant    |
| E4   | Petty Officer 3rd Class |  O4  | Lt Commander  |
| E5   | Petty Officer 2nd Class |  O5  | Commander     |
| E6   | Petty Officer 1st Class |  O6  | Captain       |
| E7   | Chief Petty Officer     |  O7  | Commodore     |
| E8   | Sr Chief Petty Officer  |  O8  | Fleet Admiral |
| E9   | Master Chief            |  O9  | Sector Admiral |
|      |                         | O10  | Grand Admiral |


#### Navy Type

A character who leaves a planetary navy to join the TransPow Fleet drops back down to rank 0.

A character ejected from the Fleet or an ætherspace navy through mishap cannot reenlist in either the Fleet or that particular ætherspace navy. A character ejected from any career may attempt to join the planetary navy again, but may join a maximum of three different planetary navies.

### Medals and Commendations

These medals are awarded during character generation whenever the character is involved in a Mishap or Event that is combat orientated and needs a skill roll to prevent injury. The result of this roll will determine what medal(s) are received by the character.

Combat Ribbon
: Any character that is in a combat Event or Mishap will automatically be awarded a Combat Ribbon.

Combat Command Ribbon
: Any officer that receives a Combat Ribbon is automatically awarded with a Combat Command Ribbon.

Purple Heart
: Any character that has to roll on the injury table having failed their skill roll is awarded a Purple Heart.

Meritorious Conduct under Fire (MCUF)
: A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of their skill roll is 3 or more.

Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry (MCG)
: A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of their Difficult (-2) skill roll is 5 or more.

Starburst for Extreme Heroism (SEH)
: A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of their Very Difficult (-4) skill roll is 6 or more.

Long Service Medal
: Any character that serves five or more terms in any Navy automatically receives the Long Service medal.

Meritorious Performance of Duties Medal
: Whenever a character needs to roll a skill on their events table and rolls a natural 12 they are deemed to have impressed their superiors enough during that term to be made a recipient of this award.


#### Medal Benefits

A character who wins a medal may apply a DM from that medal to any one Survival, Qualification or Promotion roll. The DM from a medal may only be applied once.

| Medal                             | DM |
|:----------------------------------|:--:|
| Purple Heart                      | +1 |
| Meritorious Conduct Under Fire    | +2 |
| Meritorious Performance Of Duties | +1 |
| Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry   | +3 |
| Starburst for Extreme Heroism     | +4 |
| Long Service                      | +1 |

When a character is mustering out, any medal DMs left unused may be converted into extra benefit rolls, at the rate of one roll per 2 DMs left unused, rounding down.

#### Going for Glory

A character may add up to 3 to the difficulty of the skill roll, making it much more likely to be injured. However, when it comes to receiving an award the modifier is added to the Effect instead.

### Crewman

The bulk of the crew on board any naval vessel are low–ranking crewmen, serving under more senior officers. Unlike other careers, the crewman career is divided not by specialisation, but by the type of the navy. Planetary navies are small–scale affairs, normally only a handful of pirate hunter and customs ships or system defence boats. Subsector navies provide local defence and patrol aetherspace around a number of systems. The CoreWorlds Fleet is the most prestigious assignment, but also the most dangerous.

#### Assignments

Choose one of the following:

* Planetary Navy: You served in one of the hundreds of local naval forces across known space.
* Ætherspace Navy: You served in an aetherspace navy under the seal of some group of star systems, battling pirates and protecting trade routes.
* TransPow Fleet: You served upon a major warship, watching for incursions by foreign powers.

#### Qualifications:

* Planetary Navy – Int +3
* Aetherspace Navy – Int +2
* TransPow Fleet – Int +1

If you are aged 1GSec or more: –2 DM

Per previous career: –1 DM

  ---------------------------------------------

### New Benefits

Noble Consort
: The character is offered the chance to wed a member of a highly influential noble biological family. This consort gives +2 Social Standing, and a dowry of 2d6 x 10,000 credits.

Independent Operation
: The character may set up his own business or group that works with the navy, such as a mercenary group, spy network or private think–tank. The navy will pay up to 20 ship shares or 1d6 MCr towards initial start-up costs, as long as the character agrees to favour them as a client.

Retainer
: The navy wishes to retain the character’s services, calling on him as a consultant or advisor. The character will be paid Cr. 1,000 per month on condition that he remain available for naval service when called upon.

Prototype
: You are given a prototype ship component or technology, such as an advanced weapon or combat implant. This item is technically still the property of the Imperial navy, but you are permitted to test it in the field.

Aliens
======

Alien species may have different criteria for Social Standing: Caste or Charisma. When dealing with a race that has a different concept of Social Standing, all DMs from Social Standing or its alien equivalent whether positive or negative – are halved.

In addition to their characteristics, aliens may have one or more alien traits.

Armoured
: The alien possess thick fur, scales, a bony exoskeleton or other natural protection that gives it one point of natural armour.

Aquatic
: The alien is adapted to life underwater. It can breathe underwater, or hold its breath for a long period (Endurance x 10 minutes on average). If amphibious, its Dexterity is halved on land. If the species is not amphibious, then it cannot operate out of water without mechanical aid or telepresence.

Atmospheric Requirements
: The species requires an unusual combination of gasses to breathe, and cannot survive in most atmospheres without artificial aid.

Engineered
: The species has been altered by some external factor to adapt to changed circumstances or a different environment. Medical treatment of Engineered species by a facility of a lower Technology Level than that at which the species was created receives a negative DM equal to the difference.

Fast Metabolism
: Creatures with a fast metabolism require more food than most species, and their life support costs are doubled. In combat, fast-metabolism creatures gain a +2 initiative bonus. Fast-metabolism creatures halve their Endurance for the purposes of determining fatigue.

Feral
: Feral species are uncivilised, regardless of their technological knowledge. Feral species roll Education on 1d6 only.

Flyer
: The species can fly using wings, glider membranes, gasbags or other means. Characters of this species gain the Athletics (flying) skill at Level 0 and can travel at a speed noted in their description. Flying creatures who are aloft must spend one minor action every round on movement or stall and fall out of the air.

: Winged flight is tiring and can only be sustained for a number of rounds equal to the creature’s Endurance before requiring a like amount of rest. Some specialised avians can increase this to minutes or even hours equal to Endurance.

: Species with glider membranes cannot gain altitude while flying. They descend one metre every time they move forwards and cannot use more than one minor action for flying movement in a round. 

: Species that float using gasbags or some other method do not need to move to remain aloft.

Large
: The species is considerably larger than the average for sophonts. Large creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance of 3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements for Large creatures are doubled.

: Some Large creatures are described as Huge. Attacks against Huge creatures receive a +1 DM to hit.

Natural Weapon
: The species has a natural weapon, such as claws, a strong bite or a poisonous stinger. Such weapons are usable at Personal range and deal +1 damage. The creature gains Melee (natural weapons) at level 0.

No Fine Manipulators
: The species has no fingers or other prehensile appendages, preventing them from easily picking things up, pushing small buttons, reaching into tight spaces, and so on.

Notable (Characteristic)
: Some species are notably dextrous, intelligent, tough or strong. Characters from such races have a positive Dice Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (+2 unless otherwise specified), and their racial maximum for that characteristic is increased by the same amount.

Psionic
: All members of the species are Psionic, and may determine their Psionic Strength and talents at the start of character generation.

Small
: Small species generally have a Strength and Endurance of only 1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6. The minimum size for a sophont is about half that of a human,

: Some Small creatures are described as Tiny. Attacks against Tiny creatures receive a –1 DM to hit.

Slow Metabolism
: Creatures with a slow metabolism require less food than most species, and their life support costs are halved. In combat, slow-metabolism creatures suffer a –2 initiative penalty.

Uplifted
: This species was originally non-sentient, but has been raised to a higher intelligence by another species. Uplifted races generally become client species of their patron. Two common uplifted animals are apes and dolphins:

: Uplifted apes have Notable Strength and Endurance (+2) but all other characteristics are Weak (-2). They have the Uplifted trait.

: Uplifted dolphins have Notable Strength (+4) and Notable Endurance (+2) but Weak Intelligence, Education and Social Standing (-2). They have the Uplifted, Aquatic (fully aquatic, air-breathers) and No Fine Manipulators traits.

Weak (Characteristic)
: The opposite of Notable (Characteristic), some species are weaker, less resilient or less well educated than others. Characters from such races have a negative Dice Modifier when rolling for that characteristic (-2 unless otherwise specified), and their racial maximum for that characteristic is decreased by the same amount.

Skills and Tasks
================

The Referee should only call for checks:

* when the characters are in danger.
* when the task is especially difficult or hazardous.
* when the characters are under the pressure of time.
* when success or failure is especially important or interesting.

Task Checks
-----------

To make a check, the player rolls 2d6 and any appropriate Dice Modifiers. If the total is 8 or more, the character succeeds.

The most common forms of task checks are characteristic checks and skill checks.

Characteristic Check
: These checks are used when the task is one not covered by an obvious skill, or where the character’s innate abilities are the most important influence on the result. To make a Characteristic check, roll 2d6 and add the appropriate characteristic Dice Modifier.

Skill Check
: For a skill check, the character adds both his skill level and an appropriate characteristic DM.
: When making a skill check, if a character does not have any levels in that skill, then he suffers a –3 unskilled Dice Modifier.

### Task Difficulties

|  Difficulty     |  DM  |
|:---------------:|:----:|
|  Simple         |  +6  |
|  Easy           |  +4  |
|  Routine        |  +2  |
|  Average        |  +0  |
|  Difficult      |  -2  |
|  Very Difficult |  -4  |
|  Formidable     |  -6  |

### Situational Modifiers

If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other beneficial circumstances, he receives a +1 DM to his skill check.

### Effect

If the degree of success is important, then subtract 8 from the total of the dice roll plus Dice Modifiers. This margin of success is referred to as the Effect.

#### Success

----------------------------------------------------------
 Effect  Success
-------- -------------------------------------------------
  0      Marginal Success: The character barely succeeds at the task, and may have to accept a condition on his success. He fixes the engine but it will overheat. He finds a buyer for the goods but the buyer is a untrustworthy criminal.

  1-5    Average Success: The character succeeds normally.

  6+     Exceptional Success: The character succeeds in an impressive and elegant fashion.
----------------------------------------------------------

#### Failure

----------------------------------------------------------
 Effect  Success
-------- -------------------------------------------------
  <6     Exceptional Failure: The character failed as completely as it is possibly to fail. Anything that can go wrong goes wrong. If attempting to repair a device, the device is further damaged or even destroyed. In a social situation, the character gets into further trouble.

  2-5    Average Failure: The character has failed the task.

 –1      Marginal Failure: The character has almost, almost succeeded, and the Referee may permit him to scrape a success if he takes a significant consequence. A character trying to jump across a chasm hangs onto the far side by his fingernails but can only pull himself up if he drops his backpack. A character trying to land a ship can bring it down safely but the ship may never fly again. A character hacking a computer gets in but the security programs can trace his location.

---------------------------------------------------------

### Timing

> To determine how long a task takes, roll 1d6 and multiply it by the increment listed for that action.

### Going Faster or Slower

You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one or two rows on the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) gives you a -1 DM for every row you move; moving down and increasing the time taken gives you a +1 DM for every row you move.

### Multiple Actions

A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a spacecraft’s weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing, he suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks.

### Opposed Checks

If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the character who obtains the highest Effect wins.

### Aiding Another Character 

The result of one check can give a DM to the next.

#### Task Chain DMs

| The Previous Check         | DM | The Previous Check        | DM |
|:---------------------------|:--:|:--------------------------|:--:|
| Failed With Effect –<6   – | 3  | Succeeded With Effect 0   | +0 | 
| Failed With Effect –2-5    |–2  | Succeeded With Effect 1-5 | +1 |
| Failed With Effect –1      | 1  | Succeeded With Effect 6+  | +2 |

Learning New Skills
-------------------

A character’s Skill Total is calculated by summing the levels of each skill (level zero skills count as zero). A character with Mechanic 1 and Gun Combat (slug pistols) 2 would have a Skill Total of 3.

To increase a skill, a character must train for a number of weeks equal to his current Skill Total plus the desired level of the skill. So, to advance from Pilot 2 to Pilot 3 with a current Skill Total of 3 would take (three, plus three) six weeks. A character may only train one skill in a given week.

The Jack of all Trades skill cannot be learned.

Combat
======

If the combatants are all unprepared for combat, then each rolls 2d6 and adds their Dexterity DM to determine starting Initiative. Initiative determines the order that characters act in, but it can also be spent to react to events. If some of the combatants are ready for combat and some are not, such as in an ambush, the prepared characters are considered to get an automatic 12 on their roll, giving them an Initiative of 12 + Dexterity DM.

Characters who have the Tactics skill may make a Tactics check and add the Effect of this check to the Initiative of everyone in their unit.

The Combat Round 
-----------------

Each combat round lasts around six seconds of game time. In a combat round each character gets a minor action and a significant action.

Actions are taken in descending order of Initiative. If two characters have the same Initiative, the character with the highest Dexterity goes first. If they are still tied, then characters act simultaneously. When a character acts, he takes all his actions at once.

Once everyone has acted a combat round is over and a new round begins. Initiative is not re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted up and down by actions taken during a round.

### Dynamic Initiative 

During the course of a round a character’s Initiative score may be changed by reactions, recoil and hastening. Any changes affect your Initiative for one round only - either the current round if you have yet to act or the following round if you have acted already. Reactions reduce your Initiative in order to allow you to defend yourself from attacks. Recoil slows you down if you are using a weapon heavier than you can handle. Hastening your action lets you act sooner but at a penalty to your roll.

At the start of each combat round a character may declare that he is acting hastily. This gives him a +2 bonus to his Initiative for that round only but all his actions receive a -1 DM. A character can only hasten once.

### Minor Actions 

#### Movement 

The character moves up to six metres. Difficult terrain, such as rubble, mud or thick underbrush can halve a character’s movement, allowing him to move only three metres per movement action. Crouching also halves movement.

#### Changing Stance 

A character can change to any one of the three stances - prone, crouched or standing - as a minor action.

#### Drawing and Reloading 

The time taken to draw a weapon depends on its size and ease of use. The number of minor actions to ready or reload a weapon is listed in the description of each weapon. Most weapons take one minor action to draw and another minor action to reload, but some weapons are especially fast or slow.

#### Aiming 

A character who spends a minor action aiming at a target gets a +1 DM to his next attack on the target, as long as the character does nothing except aim until he makes his attack. A character may spend multiple actions on aiming, gaining a maximum aiming DM of +6 if he spends six minor actions on aiming.

#### Miscellaneous 

The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the character’s full attention or complex physical actions.

### Significant Actions 

#### Minor Actions 

A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action.

#### Miscellaneous 

A character may make a skill check or do something else as a significant action when such an action requires the character’s full attention, concentration, complicated physical actions or some combination thereof.

#### Attack 

The most common significant action is an attack. The basic attack action is trying to injure a foe with a melee attack or a ranged weapon. The attacker declares his target, and the foe may choose to react. The attacker then makes a skill check, and if successful, deals damage to his target. As with any other skill check, the standard roll for success is 8+.

The standard skill checks used in making an attack are:

Melee Attack
: 2d6 + Melee (appropriate specialty) + (Strength or Dexterity DM (attacker’s choice))

Shooting Attack
: 2d6 + (Gun Combat (appropriate specialty) or Heavy Weapons (appropriate specialty)) + Dexterity DM

Thrown Attack
: 2d6 + Athletics (co-ordination) + Dexterity DM

##### Common Modifiers to Attacks 

-------------------------------------------------
 Modifier                Bonuses & Penalties
----------------------  -------------------------

  Aiming action          +1 per Aim action      

  Cover                   0 to -6

  Laser Sight            +1 if aiming

  Movement               -1 for every 10 full metres of target movement

  Intelligent Weapon     +1 if total DM is within the program’s tolerance      

  Target Dodges    –     -1

--------------------------------------------------

##### Recoil and Heft 

When you make an attack, compare your Strength DM to the Recoil rating of the weapon you are using. If your Strength DM is lower then the difference is applied to your initiative next round. Melee weapons have a rating called Heft which works in exactly the same way.

When firing automatic weapons in burst mode, increase Recoil by 1. When firing them on full auto increase Recoil by half the Auto score.

#### Reactions 

The more time a character spends reacting, the longer it will be until he acts himself. Each reaction lowers Initiative by 2 and applies a -1 DM to all skill checks until the following round. There is no limit to how many times a character can react in a round but a character can only react once to each attack and the penalties from reacting are cumulative.

A character can only react to attacks that he is aware of.

##### Dodging 

A character who is being attacked may dodge, giving his attacker a -1 DM and giving himself a -1 DM on all skill checks until the next round. If the character is in cover or has an obstruction to duck or dodge behind, the DM to hit him is increased to -2.

##### Parrying 

A character who is being attacked in melee can parry, applying his Melee skill as a negative DM equal to the attack roll. A parrying character also has a -1 DM on all skill checks until the next round.

### Other Actions 

#### Free Actions 

Some actions are so fast they do not even qualify as a minor action - shouting a warning, pushing a button, checking your watch, and so on. A character can perform as many of these free actions as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the Referee may require him to spend a minor or even a significant action on his various tasks.

#### Extended Actions 

Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat round to complete. Make a Timing roll for the task and then work out how many six second combat rounds it will take to complete. A character engaging in an extended action cannot do anything else but can abandon their action at any time and return to the normal Initiative order. A character who is hit by an attack while undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using the skill in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage the attack causes (after armour). Failure indicates that this round’s work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure by six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character must start again.

#### Delay 

A character does not have to act when his turn comes up in the Initiative order. He may act at any later point during the round, even interrupting another’s actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has not acted by the end of the round he may choose to act first in the next round, effectively giving up his actions in the previous round in exchange for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following round, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in Dexterity order as normal.

### Special Considerations 

#### Automatic Weapons 

Automatic weapons - any with a number listed in the Auto column are capable of three fire modes: single-shot, burst, and auto-fire.

* When using single shots, make attacks as normal.
* When using burst fire, add the Auto value to the damage. Burst fire uses a number of rounds equal to the Auto rating.
* When using auto-fire, roll a number of dice equal to the Auto rating of the weapon and sort them into pairs as you wish. Each pair is an attack. Auto-fire attacks can be allocated to as many different targets as you have attacks provided all the targets are within six metres of each other. Auto-fire attacks cannot benefit from a skill any higher than level 1. Weapon skills of 2 or higher only count as 1 when making auto-fire attacks. Auto-fire uses a number of rounds equal to 3 x the Auto rating.

#### Battlefield Comms 

Communications technology is a vital part of the battlefield. If a character is not in communication with the rest of his unit and his commander, then he cannot benefit from Tactics or Leadership. Characters who benefitted from Tactics at the start of combat and are later cut off from their commander have their Initiative lowered by the same amount it was boosted at the start of combat. Unlike other Initiative modifications, this lasts until combat ends or communication is re-established. There are several methods of communication:

Direct
: This covers hand signals and verbal communications.

Hardlinks
: Hardlinks are wires or other physical connections, and cannot be jammed.

Radio
: Radio communications allow communications as long as the radio signal can get through - they can be jammed or blocked by local conditions.

Laser
: Two characters with tight beam lasers are in communication as long as line of sight exists between a character and another friendly laser-comm equipped character.

Masers
: These work just like lasers, but can cut through smoke and aerosols.

Meson
: Meson communicators cannot be jammed or blocked, but cannot be used while a character is moving.

#### Battlefield Sensors 

There are several types of sensors.

Bioscanner
: Bioscanner ‘sniffers’ detect airborne pathogens and hazardous chemicals.

Infra-Red (Heat)
: Infra-red sensors detect warm bodies, and negate concealment from smoke and soft cover, but can be jammed by strong heat sources.

Densitometer
: An outgrowth of gravitic technology, a densitometer can scan an area and plot variable densities, effectively creating a three-dimensional map of all objects.

Electromagnetic Detectors
: These sensors can detect unshielded high-power electrical devices, such as gauss weapons or transmitters.

Laser-Assisted Targeting
: A low-powered laser is reflected off the target, giving targeting data to the firer.

Light Intensification
: Light intensification technology magnifies visible light, negating the penalties for darkness or low light.

Motion Sensors
: Can detect motion within range.

Neural Activity Sensor
: A combination of highly sensitive EM-detectors and psionic theory, NAS detectors pick up on the brain activity of living beings and classifies them according to amount and complexity, giving a rough idea of the intelligence of subjects.

#### Certain battlefield conditions affect ranged attacks: 

Darkness
: Low light gives a -1 DM to ranged attacks. Complete darkness gives a -4 DM. Light penalties can be avoided by using sensors to target instead of the naked eye.

Smoke or Fog
: Smoke gives a -1 DM to ranged attacks by obscuring the target; especially thick and impenetrable smoke gives a -2 DM. These penalties are doubled for laser weapons.

Extreme Weather
: Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth give a -1 DM to ranged attacks from poor visibility and a -1 DM to ranged attacks from environmental interference. Sensors can be used to avoid the visibility penalty.

##### Cover 

Any sort of low wall, undergrowth, convenient rocks or other objects can serve as cover. Attacks made on characters who are behind cover suffer the negative cover DM on the table below. Crouching or prone targets (see overleaf) can claim cover one step higher on the table. If a character in full cover is crouching or prone they are impossible to hit but cannot return fire.

  ----------------------------------------------------- ----------
  Cover                                                 Cover DM
  1/4 (undergrowth, small rock, corner of a building)   –0
  1/2 (thick forest, low wall, crate)                   –1
  3/4 (jungle, trench, reinforced position)             –2
  Full (pillbox)                                        –4
  ----------------------------------------------------- ----------

##### Explosions 

Grenades, rockets and other explosives affect an area. A character caught in an explosion may dodge at the usual Initiative cost. A character who dodges an explosion may reduce the damage by 1d6 if he just dodges or by half if he dives for cover. A character who dives for cover ends up prone and loses his next significant action.

##### Firing into Combat 

If a character is firing a weapon at a target who is at Personal range to another combatant, then the attack suffers a -2 DM. If the attack misses, roll 1d6. On a 4+, the attack hits the nearest other combatant to the original target.

##### Grappling 

A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead of hitting him. The attacker must move to Personal range and beat her target in an opposed Melee (unarmed) check. If she wins, she may do any one of the following:

* Knock her opponent prone.
* Disarm her opponent. If she succeeds by 6+ she can take the weapon away; otherwise it ends up on the floor.
* Throw her opponent up to three metres for 1d6 damage.
* Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect.
* Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal movement action).
* Continue the grapple with no other effects.
* Drag her opponent up to three metres.

Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. With any other option the winner can choose to end or continue the grapple as she sees fit. A character in a grapple cannot move or do anything other than make opposed Melee checks. Each time an opposed check is made the winner can choose an option from the above list.

### Range 

Personal combat is divided into a series of range bands:

  ----------- -------------------------- ---------------------------------------
  Range       Distance to Target         Squares to Target
  Personal    Less than 1.5 metres       0 (combatants are in the same square)
  Close       1.5 to 3 metres            1 to 2 squares
  Short       3 to 12 metres             3 to 8 squares
  Medium      12 to 50 metres            9 to 34 squares
  Long        51 metres to 250 metres    35 to 166 squares
  Very Long   251 metres to 500 metres   167 to 334 squares
  Distant     501 metres+                334 squares+
  ----------- -------------------------- ---------------------------------------

### Stance 

A character can be standing, crouched or prone.

A standing character uses the normal rules. A crouching character moves at half speed but can make better use of cover. If a crouching character is in cover, consider it one row lower on the Cover.

A prone character cannot make melee attacks or dodge. He may make improved use of cover like a crouching character and he may still parry melee attacks. All ranged attacks targeting him suffer a -2 DM penalty. At Close range, the penalty is reduced to +0; a prone character being attacked at Personal range grants a +2 DM to attacks against him.

### Tactics and Leadership 

The Tactics skill can be used to give an Initiative bonus to a whole unit at the start of combat. The unit commander may make a Tactics check, and everyone in the unit may increase their Initiative by the Effect of the check.

The Leadership skill can be used to increase another character’s Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a Leadership check, and the target character’s Initiative is increased by the Effect of the check. Making a Leadership skill check is a significant action.

### Thrown Weapons 

There are two kinds of thrown weapons: the first kind strike a single target and do damage from the force of their impact, such as throwing knives or a thrown rock. These use the normal rules for ranged combat.

The other kind of thrown weapon is a grenade or other explosive projectile that inflicts no damage from impact but typically delivers a harmful payload. The first kind of thrown weapon adds the Effect of the Athletics (co-ordination) check to its damage. The second does not.

If the attack fails the projectile scatters in a random direction for (6 + Effect) metres. This is usually only important if the projectile explodes on or after impact.

Damage 
-------

Each weapon lists the damage it inflicts as a number of d6. Add the Effect of the attack roll to this damage.

Damage is applied initially to the target’s Endurance. If a target is reduced to Endurance 0, then further damage is subtracted from the target’s Strength or Dexterity. If either Strength or Dexterity is reduced to 0, the character is unconscious and any further damage is subtracted from the remaining physical characteristic. If all three physical characteristics are reduced to 0, the character is killed.

### Armour 

Armour reduces damage by the value of the armour. A hit with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the target’s armour.

Vehicles 
---------

Combat in and on vehicles is much the same as ordinary combat. The differences are as follows:

Unlike people, who are mobile and manoeuvrable, careful track must be kept of which way a vehicle is facing. Vehicle-mounted weapons - and armed passengers, to a lesser extent - are restricted to certain fire arcs.

Vehicles are considered to move on the driver’s Initiative. The driver must spend a minor action every round to keep control of the vehicle under normal circumstances - a straight road or simple manoeuvres - or a significant action to navigate obstacles, conduct evasion or pursuit, or dodge incoming fire.

Attackers gain a +1 DM to hit most vehicles because of their size.

### Types of Vehicles 

There are two main types of vehicles: open and closed.

#### Closed Vehicles 

Closed vehicles grant cover to the occupants - unless the description mentions otherwise civilian vehicles grant ½ soft cover and military vehicles full hard cover.

Only a few people in a closed vehicle can shoot out, depending on the number of windows or other firing ports and the internal space available. Unless the description mentions otherwise up to two people can fire into each arc from a civilian vehicle and one person in each arc in a military one.

#### Open Vehicles 

Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers.

Any passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise attack) in any direction.

### Vehicle-Mounted Weapons

Weapons mounted on vehicles are limited in what directions they can fire. A weapon mounted in the front arc, for example, can only fire into a 90˚ area in front of the vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any direction.

### Collisions 

When a vehicle collides with something else everything takes damage. Roll 1d6 for every 10 km/h of the vehicle’s speed (round up). This is applied as damage directly to anything hit and, if the thing struck is solid enough, also to the ramming vehicle. Any unsecured passengers in a vehicle damaged in a collision take the same damage and, if possible, are thrown three metres for every 10 km/h of speed. Secured passengers (those wearing seatbelts or something similar) are not thrown anywhere and take one quarter damage.

### Vehicular Actions 

These are all significant actions that the driver of a vehicle can take when her turn in the initiative order arrives.

#### Evasive Action 

Vehicles are not typically manoeuvrable enough to dodge as a reaction. Instead, the driver may declare that she is taking evasive action when her turn arrives. She makes a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) and the Effect acts as a -DM to all attacks against the vehicle or its passengers. The Effect also acts as a -DM to any attacks made from the vehicle as well. This lasts until the driver’s next action.

#### Manoeuvring 

A driver or pilot can manoeuvre her vehicle without making a skill check. This allows the vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, to get where it is going, to move out of one fire arc of an enemy vehicle and into a different one, or to change the fire arc that a single target is in.

#### Ram 

Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires a significant action and a successful skill check (skill determined by vehicle). Rams are affected by dodging and evasive action as normal. The Referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare it automatically successful if the target is particularly large.

#### Stunt 

With a significant action and a successful vehicle control check the driver or pilot of a vehicle can do pretty much anything it is possible to do in his vehicle - stand a car up on two wheels, perform stunning aerobatics in a jet plane, or skim a speedboat over a low sandbar. A stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc for one round, to set up some other skill check using the rules for task chains, to achieve something that would normally be difficult or impossible in your vehicle, to achieve up to three manoeuvre actions in one go, just to show off, or anything else you can imagine.

#### Weave 

In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or tight underground caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave his vehicle in and around the obstacles at high speed in order to evade pursuit. The driver chooses a weaving number, as low as one or as high as one per 20 km/h of speed (round up), and must then make a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) with the weaving number as a penalty on his roll. 

If he fails, he has woven into an obstacle and crashed. If he succeeds, any pursuers must choose a weave action when their initiative count comes up and make their skill test at the same penalty with the same consequence for failure. Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit and either give up or try to reacquire the target later.

### Vehicle Damage 

Vehicles have a Hull value and a Structure value, which measure the vehicle’s structural integrity. When Hull is reduced to 0, the vehicle starts taking damage to its internal systems. When Structure is reduced to 0, the vehicle is reduced to scrap. Vehicles also suffer damage to onboard systems as they take damage.

To determine the effects of an attack on a vehicle, first determine how much damage the vehicle suffers as normal. Many vehicles will have one or more points of armour that reduces the damage. Consult the Vehicle Damage table to determine how many ‘hits’ the vehicle suffers.

#### Vehicle Damage Table 

  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------
  Damage                         Effect
  0 or less                      No damage
  1–3                            Single Hit
  4–6                            Two Single Hits
  7–9                            Double Hit
  10–12                          Three Single Hits
  13–15                          Two Single Hits, Double Hit
  16–18                          Two Double Hits
  19–21                          Triple Hit
  22–24                          Triple Hit, Single Hit
  25–27                          Triple Hit, Double Hit
  28–30                          Triple Hit, Double Hit, Single Hit
  31–33                          Two Triple Hits
  For every extra three points   +1 Single Hit
  For every extra six points     +1 Double Hit
  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------

Each hit is then applied to a particular location on the vehicle. Double or Triple hits count as two or three hits on the same location.

#### Location Table 

  ----- ------------------------ ------------------------ ----------------
  2d6   External Hit (Vehicle)   Internal Hit (Vehicle)   Robot or Drone
  2     Hull                     Structure                Hull

  ----- ------------------------ ------------------------ ----------------

##### Hull 

Reduce the vehicle or drone’s Hull by one. If a vehicle runs out of Hull, further Hull hits become hits on the same row of the Internal Damage table (if a vehicle) or Structure hits (if a robot or drone).

##### Structure 

Reduce the vehicle or drone’s Structure by one. If a vehicle runs out of Structure, it is destroyed. If the vehicle is destroyed by an attack that reduces it to a negative Structure score it explodes, doing 4d6 damage to everyone within six metres (including the occupants) and 2d6 damage to everyone within twelve metres. The occupants of a closed vehicle cannot dodge or dive for cover from this explosion but the occupants of an open vehicle can.

##### Armour 

Reduce the vehicle’s armour by one.

##### Drive 

First Hit
: Reduce movement by 10% and apply a -1 DM to all vehicle control skill checks.

Second Hit
: Reduce movement by 25% and apply a -2 DM to all vehicle control skill checks.

Third Hit
: Drive disabled.

Further drive hits count as Hull hits.

##### Weapon 

Choose a weapon or device randomly for each hit.

First Hit
: The weapon or device suffers a -2 DM to all checks related to its operation.

Second Hit
: The weapon or device is destroyed.

If no weapons remain to be destroyed, further hits on this location become Hull hits.

##### Sensors 

First Hit
: The vehicle or drone suffers a -2 DM to all Sensors checks. For drones and robots, this also applies to Recon checks.

Second Hit
: The sensors are destroyed, blinding the vehicle or drone.

Further Sensor hits count as Hull hits.

##### Power Plant 

First Hit
: The vehicle or drone loses one round’s worth of actions.

Second Hit
: The vehicle or drone’s movement is reduced by 50%.

Third Hit
: The power plant is destroyed, disabling the vehicle and inflicting 1d6 Hull hits on it.

##### Limb 

Choose a limb randomly for each limb hit.

First Hit
: The limb suffers a -2 DM to all checks related to its operation.

Second Hit
: The limb is destroyed.

Further Limb hits count as Hull hits.

##### Passengers 

Choose a passenger randomly for any passenger hit. The passenger takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If all the passengers are dead, further passenger hits become Structure hits.

##### Cargo 

Any cargo present is hit and may be destroyed. If no cargo remains, further cargo hits become Structure hits.

##### Cockpit 

The pilot of the vehicle is hit, and takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If the pilot is dead, further pilot hits become Structure hits.

##### Computer 

First Hit
: The vehicle’s computer system is disabled. A drone or robot with a disabled computer system shuts down for 1d6 rounds.

Second Hit
: The vehicle’s computer system is destroyed. A drone or robot with no computer system is completely disabled.

Further Computer hits count as Structure hits.

#### Repairs 

Damage to a vehicle or drone falls into three categories: System
Damage, Hull Damage, and Structure Damage.

System Damage
: A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1d6 hours. Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill check (Mechanic, Engineer (appropriate speciality) or Science (appropriate speciality)) taking 1-6 hours but also a source of spare parts. The spare parts can come from a scrap yard, a workshop, systems on another vehicle, or can be taken from other systems on the same vehicle. When taking spare parts from other vehicle systems, each ‘hit’ of damage provides enough spare parts to make a single repair check.

: The Passengers and Cockpit systems cannot take hits to provide spare parts, although cybernetic parts might be able to provide enough spare material to repair minor damage.

: A destroyed system costs 2d6 x 10% of its original cost to repair, and cannot be repaired using spare parts. It requires a full workshop and specialist materials.

Hull Damage
: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanic check taking 1-6 hours and consumes one ‘hit’ of spare parts.

Structure Damage
: Structure damage can only be repaired in a workshop and requires 10-60 hours per point of damage. It costs 20% of the base cost of the vehicle per point repaired. No skill check is required.

Animals
=======

Animals have a similar range of characteristics to humans, but there are several differences:

Instinct
: Instinct is the animal equivalent of Education. Animals apply their Instinct DM to tasks such as sensing prey or solving problems.

Pack
: Pack is the animal equivalent of Social Standing. The higher a creature’s Pack score, the larger the group that it is associated with, and the more standing the creature has in that group.

Behaviours
----------

Terran creatures that exemplify these behaviours are noted in brackets after the name. Characteristic modifiers and skills are noted after the description - the exact level of skills varies depending on the particular creature.

Carrion-Eater (vulture)
: Scavengers which wait for all other threats to disperse before beginning. Carrion-eaters have Recon. Instinct +2.

Chaser (wolf)
: Animals which kill their prey by attacking and exhausting it after a chase. Chasers have Athletics (co-ordination and/or endurance). Dexterity +4, Instinct +2, Pack +2.

Eater (army ant)
: Eaters will eat anything they encounter, including characters. Endurance +4. Pack +2.

Filter (earthworm)
: Herbivores which pass their environment through their bodies are termed filters. Unlike grazers, which move to food, filters move a flow of matter through themselves and filter out the food. Endurance +4.

Gatherer (raccoon, chimpanzee)
: Gatherers are herbivores that collect and store food. Gatherers have Stealth. Pack +2.

Grazer (antelope)
: Grazers move from food source to food source, often in large packs. Their primary form of defence tends to be fleeing danger. Instinct +2, Pack +4.

Hunter (baboon)
: Opportunistic predators that stalk easy prey. Hunters have Survival. Instinct +2.

Hijacker (lion)
: Scavengers which steal the kills of others through brute force or weight of numbers are hijackers. Strength +2, Pack +2.

Intimidator (coyote)
: Scavengers which establish their claim to food by frightening or intimidating other creatures. Intimidators have Persuade.

Killer (shark)
: Carnivores that possess a raw killing instinct, attacking in a frenzied manner. Killers have Melee and either Strength or Dexterity +4, Instinct +4, Pack -2.

Intermittent (elephant)
: Herbivores that do not devote their entire time to searching for food. Intermittents have Pack +4.

Pouncer (cat)
: Pouncers kill by stalking and ambushing their prey. Pouncers have Stealth, Recon and Athletics. Dexterity +4, Instinct +4.

Reducer (vermin)
: Reducers are scavengers that act constantly on all available food, devouring even the remains left by other scavengers. Pack +4

Siren (venus fly-trap)
: Sirens create a lure to attract prey. Usually, this lure will be specific to the species the siren preys on, but some rare lures are universal. Sirens have Deception. Pack -4

Trapper (spider)
: An animal which allows its prey to enter a trap. Generally, any creature surprised by a trapper is caught in its trap. Pack -2.

Creature Sizes and Characteristics
----------------------------------

For each creature, roll 2d6 for its Size and apply any Dice Modifiers from its Terrain or Movement category. The creature’s Size determines its Weight, Strength, Dexterity and Endurance – for example, a roll of 7 means that the creature has a Strength of 3d6, an Dexterity of 3d6 and an Endurance of 3d6.

Roll 2d6 separately for the animal’s Weapons and Armour. Add a +8 DM when rolling for weapons if the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4 if it is an Omnivore; subtract a –6 DM if the animal is a Herbivore. Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other weapons. If a number is present after the Weapons type, then add that number to the number of damage dice the creature rolls.

  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------

Diseases
========

Diseases reduce a character’s Characteristics, usually Endurance. The character must make an Endurance check with the listed DM to resist the effects of the disease. If the character fails the Endurance check then he takes the listed damage and must make another Endurance check a few hours or days later, depending on the interval of the disease. Once an Endurance check has been passed, the character has fought off the disease.

  ------------------- ---- -------- -----------
  Disease             DM   Damage   Interval
  Pneumonia           +0   1d6+4    1d6 weeks
  Anthrax             -3   1d6+2    1d6 days
  Regina Flu          +1   1d6–2    1d6 days
  Biological Weapon   -6   1d6+8    1d6 hours
  ------------------- ---- -------- -----------

Poisons
=======

Poisons operate in the same way as diseases, but generally work much faster and often have a wider range of effects. Most poisons do not have an interval but apply their damage immediately.

  ------------ ------ ----------------------------------------------
  Poison       DM     Damage
  Arsenic      -2     2d6
  Tranq Gas    -1d6   Unconsciousness if Endurance check is failed
  Neurotoxin   -4     1d6 Intelligence
  ------------ ------ ----------------------------------------------

Extremes of Temperature
=======================

Unusually hot or cold worlds can cause damage unless the characters are suitably protected. Temperatures are in Celsius.

  ----------------------- -----------
  Heat                    Effect
  50˚ (Very hot desert)   1d6/hour
  200˚ (\~Mercury)        1d6/round
  500˚ (\~Venus)          2d6/round
  Burning Torch           1d6/round
  Welding Torch           2d6/round
  Inferno                 3d6/round
  ----------------------- -----------

Weather
=======

High winds and torrential rain can inflict a negative Dice Modifier of -1 to -4 to all skill checks.

Falling
=======

A character who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1d6 damage per two metres fallen. High- or low-gravity worlds will increase or decrease the damage. Look up the size code for the world and the gravity level associated with it and multiply the falling damage by the gravity number.

Fatigue
=======

A fatigued character suffers a –2 DM to all checks until he rests. The amount of rest needed is 3 - the character’s Endurance DM hours. If a character suffers fatigue while already fatigued they fall unconscious.

Unconsciousness
===============

An unconscious character may make an Endurance check after every minute of unconsciousness - if successful, he regains consciousness. If he fails he must wait another minute and can then try again with a +1 DM on the check for every check previously failed.

Injury and Recovery
===================

Injured characters are either wounded or seriously wounded. A character is considered seriously wounded if he has lost at least one point from all three of his physical characteristics. As soon as one of his physical characteristics is restored, no matter how, he is no longer seriously wounded.

Seriously wounded characters who have somehow avoided unconsciousness cannot move except to hobble or crawl along at 1.5 metres per combat round. They also lose their minor action in combat.

Wounded characters heal naturally and can also benefit from medical care. When characteristic points return from healing, players may choose which characteristic regains the points and may split healing between characteristics if they wish.

Natural Healing
---------------

An injured character regains a number of characteristic points equal to her 1d6 + Endurance DM per day of full rest. If the character continues an active lifestyle she only heals a number of characteristic points equal to 1 + Endurance DM per day. Characters with a low Endurance DM (quite possibly from injury) may degrade (lose more characteristic points) over time if they are unlucky or cannot (or will not) rest.

A seriously wounded character only regains characteristic points equal to her Endurance DM per day of rest, which means that the character may never heal naturally and will even get worse if her Endurance DM is currently negative.

Medical Treatment 
------------------

First Aid
: Applying first aid restores a number of characteristic points equal to twice the Effect of the Medic check. Points restored by first aid are divided as desired among all damaged physical characteristics. First aid must be applied within five minutes of the injuries being received to be fully effective. A character can still benefit from first aid up to an hour after their injury but they only receive a number of characteristic points equal to the Effect of the Medic check. Performing first aid on yourself is a Difficult (-2) task.

Surgery
: A character who is seriously wounded (after first aid has been applied) requires surgery. Surgery restores characteristic points just like first aid but if the check is failed the patient loses characteristic points equal to the Effect. Surgery requires a hospital or sickbay. Once one characteristic is back to its maximum level the patient can benefit from medical care. Surgery does not benefit characters who are not seriously wounded. Performing surgery on yourself is a Very Difficult (-4) task.

Medical Care
: Medical care restores 2 + the character’s Endurance DM + the doctor’s Medic skill in characteristic points per day, divided evenly among all damaged characteristics. Medical care requires a hospital or sickbay and for the patient to undergo full bed rest.

Augmentation and Medical Care
: Cybernetic or genetic augments can interfere with medical treatment. All medical care or surgery Medic rolls treating a character suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Technology Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant.

Healing and Mental Characteristics
----------------------------------

Other than Psionic Strength, characters may also suffer damage to their Intelligence or even their Education. Unless otherwise specified, each mental characteristic heals at the rate of one point per day.

Sample Patrons
==============

Each patron encounter lists:

* The patron’s name and role.
* The skills and resources required to complete the mission
* The suggested reward for the mission
* The mission as described to the characters
* What’s really going on. Several possible variants will be presented - either pick or roll for which is the real situation.

### Jefri haut-Oschem, Planetologist

Required
: Life Sciences, Survival; Spacecraft

Reward
: Cr. 2,000/day plus expenses.

#### Players’ Information

His Excellency haut-Oschem is a respected Planetologist, specialising in worlds that are nearly habitable. A planet might be a little too cold, or too dry, or be infested with a lethal native species. Haut-Oschem’s genius is in making tiny changes to a planet’s ecosystem or climate. All too often, a change can ripple out through the complex balances of a planetary environment and have unforeseen consequences.

Haut-Oschem requires a spacecraft and a crew trained in the sciences for a brief period of research – no more than a few weeks, possibly a month or two. While haut-Oschem has worked with the Scout Service in the past, this mission is entirely under the aegis of private research. The ship will be visiting worlds outside settled space.

#### Referee’s Information

Any character with contacts in the Scout service can find out that haut-Oschem has quarrelled with the Survey section, and that his once-stellar career has dark clouds hanging over it. Something has gone wrong…

1. Haut-Oschem has been replaced in the eyes of the Scout service by a younger researcher, Harad Leish. Old haut-Oschem wants to prove that his theories and methodologies are still valid. Leish and a laboratory ship from the Scout Service are currently surveying a jungle world inhabited by numerous hostile species. To prove his worth, haut-Oschem needs to find a way for humans to live safely on the world before the Scout service do.

2. As above, but haut-Oschem is bitter, and his real plan is to sabotage Leish’s survey team.

3. Haut-Oschem has discovered that he made a terrible mistake at the start of his career. He approved the settlement of a world before he fully understood the ecosystem. Every few centuries, a species of carnivorous locusts hatches in vast swarms and devours everything in their path. The characters need to find a way to stop the insects from hatching.

4. As above, but haut-Oschem wants to preserve his reputation above all else. The characters need to stop the insects without revealing what they’re doing to the settlers.

5. Haut-Oschem discovered something very valuable on his most recent survey, such as a massive deposit of precious metals or alien technology. He wants the characters to help him recover it.

6. As above, but haut-Oschem is in a race with the Scout service. He’s not the only one to have read between the lines in his latest survey.

Equipment
=========

Each item is listed with the Technology Level needed to manufacture it, its mass (in kg) and its cost. If an item’s mass or cost is not listed, then its mass or cost is negligible.

Credits
-------

The Credit (Cr.) is the standard unit of currency in Traveller. Larger denominations include the KiloCredit (KCr; 1,000 Credits) and the MegaCredit (MCr; 1,000,000 Credits).

Armour
------

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armour can be worn at a time. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer layer of armour is next applied to the inner layer.

Some armours have a required skill. A character suffers a -2 DM to all actions taken in the armour per missing skill level, including level 0.

Jack (TL 1)
: A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs.

Mesh (TL 6)
: A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.

Cloth (TL 7)
: A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can result in bruising. However, cloth armour is highly useful and versatile – it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice something unusual.

Flak Jacket (TL 7)
: A less expensive version of ballistic cloth, the bulky flak jacket is an unmistakably military garment.

Vacc Suit (TL 8)
: The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer’s best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum, for six hours.

Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8)
: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites, and high pressure environments like undersea trenches.

Ablat (TL 9)
: A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armour is made from a material that ablates (vaporises) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat reduces its armour value (versus lasers) by one, but the armour is cheap and easily replaceable.

Reflec (TL 10)
: Reflec armour is a flexible plastic suit with layers of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armour.

Combat Armour (TL 11)
: This full-body suit is used by the military and not generally available on the open market, although those with military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty. It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armour protects from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life support for six hours.

Battle Dress (TL 13)
: The ultimate personal armour, battle dress is a powered form of combat armour. The servomotors vastly increase the user’s speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by +4 while wearing the armour. Damage to the wearer’s characteristics is calculated as normal, but the values from the armour are used for all other purposes such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in computer/2 running an Expert Tactics (military)/2 program to give tactical advice and updates and is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full protection against environmental hazards - including NBC shielding - as if it was an HEV suit. TL 14 battle dress is considerably stronger, giving Strength +6 instead of +4, and upgrades its internal systems to Computer/3 (although still running Tactics 2).

### Options

Most of the options listed here can also be applied to normal clothing at the same cost. The exceptions are extended life support and grav assist.

Eye Protection (TL 6)
: Many armours include eye protection such as visors or goggles to guard against flying debris but such protection becomes absolutely vital at TL 9 to guard against the blinding effects of lasers. Eye protection can be added to any armour and is included for free in any TL 9+ armour. Cr 50.

Magnetic Grapples (TL 8)
: Magnetic plates in the boots of the armour allow the user to walk normally on a spacecraft without artificial gravity. Cr. 100.

Computer Weave (TL 10)
: Computer weave can be added to any armour that does not already have a computer system, and gives Computer/0 to that armour. Cr 500.

Extended Life Support (TL 10)
: This upgrade can be added to any suit that provides life support (vacc suit, HEV suit, combat armour, battle dress). By adding high-pressure oxygen tanks and recycling systems, the suit now provides eighteen hours of oxygen. Cr. 10,000.

Medikit (TL 10)
: An internal medical scanner and drug injector, the medikit can be installed in combat armour, battle dress or a vacc suit. It automatically applies first aid if the wearer is reduced to Endurance 0 (treat the Medikit as having Medic 3). It can also administer Fast Drug on command, or if life support systems are failing (turning remaining minutes of life support into hours). Cr 5,000. A TL 11 medikit can also inject Combat or Slow drugs and the Slow Drug antidote on command. Cr 10,000.

Smart Fabric (TL 10)
: Smart fabric resists stains and dirt, cleaning itself automatically. Cr. 1,000.

IR Chameleon (TL 12)
: IR (infra-red) chameleon technology can be added to any full-body suit of clothing or armour. It selectively bleeds heat to match background IR levels and effectively renders the wearer invisible to IR (Very Difficult (–4) to detect with sensors). IR Chameleon costs Cr. 5,000.

Grav Assist (TL 12)
: This upgrade can be added to combat armour or battle dress only, and adds the functionality of a grav belt to the armour at the cost of Cr. 110,000. The TL 15 version lasts longer. Costs Cr 120,000.

Vislight Chameleon (TL 13)
: A more advanced form of IR Chameleon, Vislight Chameleon covers the surface of the armour with light-bending technology, making the wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye (+4 DM to Stealth rolls). Vislight Chameleon costs Cr. 50,000.

Augments
--------

Augmentation can bring characteristics above the normal maximum for a race.

Augments can interfere with medical treatment. All long-term care or surgery Medic rolls treating an augmented character suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Technology Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant. For example, a character with TL 15 Endurance implants being treated in a TL 10 hospital would give a -5 DM to the surgeon’s Medic skill checks.

Neural Comm (TL 10)
: A neural comm has identical capacities to a standard comm, but the cost is much higher and the TL is increased by 2. For example, an audio-only comm costs 250 Credits and is TL 10. A character can access the capabilities of a neural comm by thought alone but must still make any relevant skill checks and must still speak aloud to send audio messages.

  ------- ------------------------------------ ------------
  TL 10   Audio only                           Cr. 1,000
  TL 12   Audio and visual, Computer/0         Cr. 5,000
  TL 14   Multiple forms of data, Computer/1   Cr. 20,000
  ------- ------------------------------------ ------------

Subdermal Armour (TL 10)
: Adds a mesh of ballistic fibres to the skin and reinforces the bones, giving the character extra armour. Subdermal armour stacks with other protection.

  ------- ---------- -------------
  TL 10   Armour 1   Cr. 50,000
  TL 11   Armour 3   Cr. 100,000
  ------- ---------- -------------

Physical Characteristic Augmentation (TL 11)
: A character’s Endurance, Strength or Dexterity can be increased in various ways, from replacing
motor neurons with faster synthetic cells, to reinforcing bones and replacing organs with tougher vat-grown clones. Augmentations must be purchased for each characteristic separately.

  ------- ------------------- ---------------
  TL 11   Characteristic +1   Cr. 500,000
  TL 12   Characteristic +2   Cr. 1,000,000
  TL 15   Characteristic +3   Cr. 5,000,000
  ------- ------------------- ---------------

Augmentation (TL 12)
: Replacing slow nerve cells with faster synthetic substrates and implanting optoelectronic boosters can increase the speed at which a character thinks, effectively boosting his Intelligence.

  ------- ----------------- ---------------
  TL 12   Intelligence +1   Cr. 500,000
  TL 14   Intelligence +2   Cr. 1,000,000
  TL 16   Intelligence +3   Cr. 5,000,000
  ------- ----------------- ---------------

Skill Augmentation (TL 12)
: The character’s nervous system is rewired to be more suited to a particular task. A pilot might have his reflexes and sense of balance improved; a broker might be made capable of controlling his pupil responses and smelling the pheromones and skin salinity of the other party. A skill augmentation gives the character a +1 DM when using that skill. Cr. 50,000. A character can only have one skill augmentation and must possess that skill at level 0 to benefit from the augmentation.

Wafer Jack (TL 12)
: A wafer jack is a computer system implanted into the base of the skull that consists of an external data socket and a processor running an interface program. A character with a wafer jack can use expert programs for tasks relying on Intelligence or Education only. The main benefit of the jack is that it is much smaller and more discrete than a hand computer, and the user can access the expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack is a Computer/2 (Computer/4 at TL 13) and can only run expert programs. It is always running Intelligent Interface at no cost. Cr. 10,000. (Cr. 15,000 at TL 13.)

Enhanced Vision (TL 13)
: A character can be implanted with cybernetic eyes giving him the abilities of a set of binoculars and IR/ Light Intensifier goggles at the cost of Cr. 25,000.

Communications
--------------

Bug (TL 5)
: Surveillance devices such as hidden microphones and tiny cameras, bugs are available from TL 5 onwards. They rapidly miniaturise and become more intelligent. A TL 14 bug can be no bigger than a dust mote. The smaller a bug, though, the shorter its range - a bug that transmits data needs a much larger power supply than one that just records until it is collected.

  ------- -------------------------------------- ---------
  TL 5    Audio                                  Cr. 50
  TL 7    Audio or Visual                        Cr. 100
  TL 9    Audio or Visual or Data                Cr. 200
  TL 11   Audio/Visual/Data                      Cr. 300
  TL 13   Audio/Visual/Data/Bioscan              Cr. 400
  TL 15   Audio/Visual/Data/Bioscan/Computer/1   Cr. 500
  ------- -------------------------------------- ---------

* Audio: The bug records anything it hears.
* Visual: The bug records anything it sees.
* Data: If attached to a computer system, the bug can search and copy data from the computer. The bug cannot breach computer security on its own, but if a user accesses the computer in the bug’s  presence, the bug can read his data.
* Bioscan: The bug has a basic biological scanner, allowing it to sample the area for DNA traces, chemical taint and so forth.
* Computer/1: The bug has an onboard computer system with Computer/1

A bug can be active or passive. An active bug transmits data (either constantly, or when triggered). Passive bugs just record until activated.

Transceiver (TL 5)
: A transceiver is a stand-alone communications device. Unlike a comm, which relies on the presence of an established communications network, a transceiver can send and receive directly under its own power.

To reach orbit reliably, a transceiver needs a range of 500 kilometres.

Comm (TL 6)
: A personal comm unit is a portable telecommunications device/computer/camera, ranging in size from a bulky handset to a slim watch or pen-like cylinder. Larger comms have physical controls and screens, while smaller units either project data and control displays onto nearby surfaces, have fold-out plastic screens, or connect to cybernetics. Comms have only short-range transmission and reception capabilities, but most technologically advanced worlds will have planet-wide comm networks allowing the user to send messages and access data anywhere.

  TL 10   Multiple forms of data, computer/1   Cr. 500
  ------- ------------------------------------ ---------

Commdot (TL 10)
: A commdot is a tiny microphone/speaker and transmitter, ranging in size between a few centimetres and a few millimetres across. A commdot is capable of interfacing with another communications device and relaying messages back and forth. Commdots have a range of only a few metres. They are usually used as hands-free communicators, but can also be used as improvised bugs or throat microphones. Cr. 10 each.

Holographic Projector (TL 11)
: A holographic projector is a toaster-sized box that, when activated, creates a three-dimensional image in the space around it or nearby – the range is approximately three metres in all directions. The image can be given pre-programmed animations within a limited range and the projector includes speakers for making sound. The projected holograms are obviously not real so this device is mostly used for communication. The TL 12 version can produce holograms real enough to fool anyone who fails an Intelligence check (made upon first seeing the hologram) and the TL 13 version can produce holograms that are true-to-life images.

Computers
---------

The power of a computer is given by its rating (Computer/1, Computer/2 and so forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run. (Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of programs up to its rating .

The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above. Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing power for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-game. Desktops become obsolete during TL 8.

  TL 14        Computer/5       0.5         5,000
  ------------ ---------------- ----------- ------------

Computer Terminal (TL 7)
: This is a ‘dumb terminal’, with only limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful computer such as a ship’s computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size depending on their control method – a holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and screen. A computer terminal has Computer/0, and costs Cr. 200.

Hand Computer (TL 7)
: A hand computer is a portable computer system with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer costs twice as much as a normal computer of the same TL but can he held in one hand and operated with the other.

### Options

Data Display/Recorder (TL 13)
: This headpiece worn over one or both eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing him to view computer data from any linked system. Because of the transparent screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers - they can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results and so forth. Cr. 5,000.

Data Wafer (TL 10)
: The principle medium of information storage is the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of data storage. Cr 5.

Computer
: A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only. The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Computer/1, but it could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially designed for that task. A specialised computer costs 25% more per added rating. In addition, running the program a computer is specialised for does not use up rating when working out how many programs the computer can run simultaneously.

Software
--------

A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to a minimum of the lowest rating shown.

Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

Medical Supplies
----------------

Cryoberth (TL 10)
: A cryoberth, or ‘icebox’, is a coffin-like machine similar to the low or frozen berths used on some spacecraft. A cryoberth can be used to place a severely injured character into stasis until he receives medical treatment. While in a cryoberth, a character’s wounds neither heal nor degrade and all disease and poison activity is halted. A cryoberth’s internal power system can function for up to one week on its own, but a berth is usually connected to a vehicle’s power supply. Wt. 200 kg, Cr. 50,000.

Medikit (TL 8+)
: There are different types of medikit available at different Technology Levels. All medikits contain diagnostic devices and scanners, surgical tools and a panoply of drugs and antibiotics, allowing a medic to practise his art in the field. Higher-technology medikits do not give a bonus to basic treatment, but can help with more exotic problems or when treating augmented individuals. For example, a TL 8 medikit can test blood pressure and temperature (among other things); a TL 14 kit has a medical densitometer to create a three-dimensional view of the patient’s body and can scan brain activity on the quantum level. All medikits weigh 8 kg.

* TL 8: Cr, 1,000.
* TL 10: Cr. 1,500.
* TL 12: Cr. 5,000.
* TL 14: Cr. 10,000.

### Drugs

Medicinal Drugs (TL 5+)
: include vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from five credits to several thousand credits, depending on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than doing nothing. With a successful Medic check the correct drug can counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult (-2 DM) poison with a damage of 1d6.

Panaceas (TL 8+)
: are wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A character using panaceas may make a Medic check as if he had Medic 0 when treating an infection or disease. Panaceas cost 200 credits per dose.

Anti-rad drugs (TL 8)
: must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs once per day - taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1d6 per dose. Cr. 1,000 per dose.

Stim drugs (TL 8)
: remove fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If stims are used to remove fatigue again without an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three points the third time, and so on. Stims cost 50 credits per dose.

Metabolic accelerator (‘Slow Drug’, TL 10)
: boosts the user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in  5 seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. He suffers 2d6 points of damage and is exhausted. Metabolic accelerator costs 500 credits per dose.

Combat Drug (TL 10)
: This drug increases reaction time and improves the body’s ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued. Combat drugs cost 1,000 credits per dose.

Medicinal Slow (TL 11)
: is a variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo technology is available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day. Medicinal slow costs 500 credits per dose.

Fast Drug (TL 10) or ‘Hibernation’
: puts the user into a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to a ratio of 60 to 1 - a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth. Fast drug costs 200 credits per dose.

Anagathics (TL 15)
: slow the user’s aging process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels. Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. They cost 2,000 Credits per dose. One dose must be taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect - if the character taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted supply.

### Medical Care

Healing
: An injured character who needs hospital care for a prolonged period will pay approximately 100 credits per month per Technology Level. (At TL 11+ the doctors will just use medicinal slow in most cases and charge for that instead.) Surgery costs 1d6 x 50 x Technology Level in Credits.

Replacements
: A character whose injuries require cloning limbs or cybernetic replacement must pay 5,000 credits per Characteristic point.

Robots and Drones
-----------------

A robot has an Intellect program running, allowing it to make decisions independently, while drones are remote-controlled by a character with the Remote Operations skill.

Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence and Education score. Drones have neither. A robot’s Education characteristic is representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing characteristics of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some exceptions, usually high-end models running advanced Intellect programs. Drones do not have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use his own Social Standing score.

Cargo Robot (TL 11)
: These simple, heavy-duty robots are found in starport docks and on board cargo ships. Cargo drones can be constructed as low as Technology Level 9 but their utility is extremely limited until the invention of Intellect programs.

>
> Weapons: Surgical Tools (Melee (small blade), 1d6 damage)
>
> Price: 40,000 Credits

Combat Drone (TL 12)
: Combat drones are little more than flying guns mated to a grav floater and a computer system. The drones must be piloted with the Remote Operations skill but attacks are made using the appropriate weapon skill. Combat drones loaded with Intellect and combat Expert programs (making them autonomous combat robots) are illegal on many worlds.

> Strength 12 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+1), Hull 4, Structure 4
>
> Traits: Armour 9, Integral System (grav floater), Integral Weapon (any)
>
> Weapons: Any gun
>
> Price: 90,000 Credits plus the cost of the weapon (the Integral Weapon upgrade is included)

Servitor (TL 13)
: Servitor robots are expensive humanoid robots who are programmed to act as butlers or servants to the nobility. Some servitor owners reprogram their robots with Expert Carouse or Expert Gambler to better suit their lifestyle.

> Strength 7 (+0), Dexterity 9 (+1), Hull 2, Structure 2
> Intelligence 9 (+1), Education 12 (+2), Social Standing 7 (+0)
>
> Traits: Computer/3 (running Intellect/1 and Expert Steward/2 - servitors also have Expert Diplomacy/2 and Translator/1 available should they be necessary)
>
> Weapons: Robot Punch (Melee (unarmed), 1d6 damage)
>
> Price: 120,000 Credits

### Options

Armour
: Armour can be increased by 5, which increases the drone or robot’s cost by 25%.

Integral System
: Certain devices can be built into drones or robots by increasing the cost of the device by +50%. Popular choices include toolkits of different kinds, various sensors, or mobility upgrades like thruster packs or grav floaters.

Integral Weapon
: Any suitable weapon can be added to a drone or robot, at the cost of Cr. 10,000 + the cost of the weapon.

Sensors
-------

At TL 11 sensors become notably more discriminating because they can be hooked up to a system running Intellect/1 that can dynamically filter information based on pre-set parameters – not sounding the alarm if the motion sensor picks up anything too small to be an intruder, for example.

Sensor equipment does not offer a bonus to skill checks but allows the user to find things that they would otherwise not be able to.

Binoculars (TL 3)
: Allows the user to see further. 1 kg, Cr. 75. At TL 8 electronic enhancement allows images to be captured; light-intensification allows them to be used in the dark. Cr 750. At TL 12 PRIS (Portable Radiation Imaging System) allows the user to observe a large section of the EM-spectrum, from infrared to gamma rays. Cr 3,500.

Geiger Counter (TL 5)
: Detects radiation, both presence and approximate intensity. Cr. 250. The Sensors skill is not needed to detect the presence of radiation with a Geiger counter but anything more complex than that requires a check.

IR Goggles (TL 6)
: Permits the user to see exothermic (heat-emitting) sources in the dark. Cr. 500.

Light-Intensifying Goggles (TL 7)
: Permits the user to see normally in anything less than total darkness by electronically intensifying any available light. Cr. 500.
: At TL 9, IR goggles and light-intensifying goggles can be combined into a single unit costing Cr. 1,250.

Motion Sensor (TL 7)
: A motion sensor simply detects any and all movement within the area assigned to it. It cannot differentiate between kinds of movement, it just reports whether there is movement or not in an area roughly six metres in diameter. Cr. 500. At TL 9 the motion detector can report the general qualities of motion – size, speed and duration – but no more. Cr. 1,000. The Sensors skill is not required to use a motion detector to detect motion. When trying to interpret data from a TL 9 motion sensor, the Sensors skill may need to be checked.

Electromagnetic Probe (TL 10)
: This handy device detects the electromagnetic emissions of technological devices, and can be used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out what’s wrong with it) or when searching for hidden bugs or devices. Cr 1,000. The Sensors or Investigation skills can be used to sweep a room for bugs.

Densitometer (TL 14)
: The remote densitometer uses an object’s natural gravity to measure its density, building up a three-dimensional image of the inside and outside of an object. 5 kg. Cr. 20,000.

Bioscanner (TL 15)
: The bioscanner ‘sniffs’ for organic molecules and tests chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever it is focussed on. It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter, search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms. 3.5 kg. Cr. 350,000. The data from a bioscanner can be interpreted using the Sensors or the Life Sciences (biology) skills.

NAS (TL 15)
: This device consists of a backpack and detachable handheld unit, and can detect neural activity up to 500 metres away. The device can also give a rough estimation of the intelligence level of organisms based on brainwave patterns. 10 kg. Cr 35,000. The data from a neural activity scanner can be interpreted using the Sensors, the Life Sciences (biology) or the Social Sciences (sophontology) skills.

Survival Gear and Supplies
--------------------------

Tent (TL 3)
: A basic tent provides shelter for two people against the weather, reducing skill check penalties by 2. Cr. 200. The TL 7 tent can be pressurised. There is no airlock – the tent is depressurised when opened. Cr 2,000.

Rebreather (TL 6)
: The rebreather is a bulky backpack containing breathable atmosphere and a face mask that collects exhaled gasses and ‘scrubs’ them back into breathable gasses again. A rebreather provides six hours of breathable atmosphere and can be used to breathe in any environment that is not otherwise harmful, such as underwater. 10 kg, Cr. 250.

Respirator (TL 6)
: This device concentrates inhaled oxygen, allowing a character to breathe on worlds with a thin atmosphere. Respirators take the form of a face mask or mouthpiece initially. Cr. 100. The more advanced TL 10 respirator is small enough to fit into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 x cost. Cr. 2,000.

Filter (TL 7)
: Filters are breathing masks that strip out harmful elements from the air inhaled by the character, such as dangerous gases or dust particles. Cr 100. The TL 10 filter is small enough to fit into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 x cost. Cr. 2,000.

Breather Mask (TL 8)
: Combines the filter and respirator into a single package. Cr. 150.

Artificial Gill (TL 8)
: Extracts oxygen from water allowing the wearer to breathe underwater. Only works on worlds with breathable atmospheres (type 4–9). 4 kg. Cr 4,000.

Environment Suit (TL 8)
: Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat, the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed in normal operations. Costs Cr 500.

Habitat Module (TL 8)
: A modular, unpressurised quarters for six people, capable of withstanding anything less than hurricane-force winds. Includes survival rations and enough batteries to keep the lights on and the heaters (or air conditioning) running for a week. Requires 12 man-hours to assemble, and can be attached to other modules to form a base. Cr 10,000. The TL 10 module is pressurised, and includes life-support for six occupants for one week (1000 person/hours). Cr 20,000.

Rescue Bubble (TL 9)
: A large (2m diameter) pressurised plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user’s movements into electricity to recharge the bubble’s batteries and power its distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space and sea vessels as emergency lifeboats. Cr. 600.

Thruster Pack (TL 9)
: A simple thruster pack gives the user the ability to manoeuvre in zero-gravity. A Zero-G check is required to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in microgravity environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at Adjacent range. Cr. 2,000.
: At TL 12 the long-range thruster pack gives 0.1g acceleration for up to 48 hours, using standard starship fuel. This increases its practical range on the spacecraft scale to Short but gives it a weight of 10 kg. Cr. 14,000. The TL 14 version of the long-range pack is much smaller as it uses grav-thruster plates instead, but has the same performance profile as the TL 12 version. Cr. 20,000.

Portable Generator (TL 10)
: This is a heavy-duty portable fusion generator, capable of recharging weapons and other equipment for up to one month of use. Cr. 500,000.

### Options

Self-Assembling (TL 11)
: The self-assembling upgrade can be given to tents, habitat modules and other basic structures. The structure is capable of expanding and assembling itself with only minimal aid, reducing the time needed to set up the shelter to a single man-hour. Cr. 5,000.

Self-Sealing (TL 13)
: Structures can be made self-repairing and self-sealing at TL 13 for Cr. 2,000. Small breaches and rips are automatically fixed in seconds.

Toolkits
--------

Technical skills require specialist tools of various kinds. These kits contain diagnostic sensors, hand tools, computer analysis programs and spare parts. All kits cost Cr. 1,000 and weigh 12 kg.

> Engineer (specific specialty): Required for performing repairs and installing new equipment.
>
> Forensics: Required for investigating crime scenes and testing samples.
>
> Mechanical: Required for repairs and construction.
>
> Scientific: Required for scientific testing and analysis.
>
> Surveying: Required for planetary surveys or mapping.

Weapons
-------

Weapons are described with the following statistics:

TL
: The lowest Technology Level at which the weapon is available.

Range
: The range modifiers used for that weapon.

Damage
: The damage the weapon inflicts.

Auto
: The Auto rating of the weapon if it is capable of automatic fire.

Recoil
: The Recoil rating of the weapon.

Mass
: The amount, in kilograms, that the weapon weighs on a world with Earth-like gravity.

Magazine
: The number of shots the weapon can take before needing to be reloaded or connected to a new power pack. Unless specified otherwise in the weapon’s description it takes only a single minor action to reload or two to switch to a new power pack.

Cost
: The weapon’s cost in credits.

Ammo Cost/Power Pack
: The cost in credits to buy a spare magazine for a gun or a spare power pack for an energy weapon.

### Melee Weapons

Blade
: A hybrid knife weapon, somewhere between a dagger and a cutlass, with a large basket hilt.

Broadsword
: A heavy two-handed sword.

Cutlass
: The standard shipboard blade weapon, often kept near airlocks to repel boarders.

Rapier
: A character using a rapier increases their effective Melee (large blade) skill by one level when parrying.

Club
: Whether a handy length of metal piping or an extending riot baton made of advanced polymers, the club remains a popular and practical weapon wherever intelligent species gather.

Dagger
: Daggers are especially suited to close-quarters combat - while grappling someone armed with a dagger can do Effect + 4 damage if they choose to hurt their opponent.

Improvised Weapon
: When there’s no real weapon available and your bare hands just aren’t enough, any snatched-up object can be used as an impromptu club.

Shield
: A character using a shield increases their effective Melee (unarmed) skill by one level when parrying. A character with no Melee counts as having Melee 0 when using a shield to parry.

Staff
: A length of wood or metal that can be used in a variety of combat styles, to aid walking, or to poke potentially dangerous things from a distance.

Stunstick
: This melee weapon deals 2d6 stun damage in addition to its normal damage. A character struck by a stun stick must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the stun damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed, the character is knocked unconscious.

### Slug Throwers

Accelerator Rifle
: Also known as gyrojet weapons, accelerator rifles are designed for zero-gravity combat. They fire tiny missiles that leave the rifle with minimal velocity and thus minimal recoil, then accelerate to high speed.

Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)
: The ultimate evolution of the conventional firearm, advanced combat rifles are the weapon of choice for many military units. Standard equipment includes an electronic battlefield sight, incorporating both light amplification and IR abilities, visual magnification up to 5x zoom, and a laser rangefinder which may also be used as a target painting device (reveals exact distance to target). The weapon is also gyroscopically stabilised during firing.

Antique Pistol
: Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1 DM to attacks. Antique pistols require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug pistol) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again.

Antique Rifle
: Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1 DM to attacks. Antique rifles require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug rifle) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again.

Assault Rifle
: Assault rifles fire lighter projectiles than rifles, but are capable of a higher rate of fire and are more suitable to short-range encounters.

Autopistol
: Variants of this semi-automatic pistol are the standard sidearm for law enforcement officers and criminals.

Autorifle
: Automatic rifles have a higher muzzle velocity and are capable of automatic fire. Also termed battle rifles.

Body Pistol
: Body pistols are manufactured from plastics and cultured bone, making them very difficult to detect using conventional weapons scanners. Body pistols increase the difficulty of Sensors checks to detect them to Very Difficult (-4).

Gauss Rifle
: Gauss rifles replace conventional rifles at TL 13. Like the smaller gauss pistol, rifles fire high-velocity projectiles using electromagnetic rails.

Gauss Pistol
: Gauss pistols use electromagnetic coils to accelerate metallic darts to hypersonic speeds. Gauss weapons are lightweight, efficient and deadly.

Revolver
: A conventional six-shooter handgun. Revolvers take two minor actions to reload.

Rifle
: Reloading a rifle requires two minor actions.

Shotgun
: A shotgun using pellet ammunition ignores Dodge dice modifiers, but Armour gives double protection against pellet attacks. A shotgun can also fire solid slugs, which follow all the normal rules for shooting.

Snub Pistol
: These lightweight, low-recoil weapons were designed for use aboard spacecraft and in zero gravity.

### Energy Weapons

A laser that hits with Effect 6+ will permanently blind its target unless they are wearing some sort of eye protection.

Laser Carbine
: Laser carbines are shorter and lighter than laser rifles, and have a correspondingly shorter range.

Laser Pistol
: The TL 9 pistol is bulky, but effective, with no recoil and a large magazine. At TL 11, advances in battery technology and miniaturisation mean that the pistol is no larger than a conventional firearm, but must still be connected to a battery pack for sustained use.

Laser Rifle
: Laser rifles are highly accurate at long range. They are powered by heavy backpacks, although they have an internal battery that can store enough energy for six shots for mobile sniping.

Plasma Rifle
: TL 16 technology allows the bulky reactor and plasma chamber of the PGMP to be made small enough to fit into a rifle frame. The plasma rifle is a high-power sniper weapon designed to crack Battle Dress. Because of its internal reactor it never runs out of ammunition.

Stunners
: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

### Grenades

Aerosol
: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist six metres in radius that diffusess lasers but does not block normal vision. Any laser attack made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser communications through the mist are completely blocked. The mist dissipates in 1d6 x 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

Frag
: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance from the blast:

  ---------- --------
  Distance   Damage
  3 metres   5d6
  6 metres   3d6
  9 metres   1d6
  ---------- --------

Smoke
: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a -2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1d6 x 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

Stun
: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

### Heavy Weapons

Grenade Launcher
: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances.

RAM Grenade Launcher
: Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full auto; unlike other weapons with an Auto score, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade launcher.

Rocket Launcher
: To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive backblast. Anyone up to 1.5 metres behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3d6 damage from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person. It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher.
: The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything within six metres of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1d6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect metres away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating.

PGMP
: It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it.

FGMP
: It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP (minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2d6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate vicinity.

### Explosives

The Explosives skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the Explosives skill check multiplies the damage, with a minimum of x1 damage for an Effect of 0 or 1.

Plastic
: This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favourite of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across known space.

TDX
: An advanced gravity-polarised explosive, TDX explodes only along the horizontal axis.

Pocket Nuke
: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pocket nuke is actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a grenade launcher.

  ------------- ---- ---------- ------------- ------------
  Weapon        TL   Damage     Radius        Cost (Cr.)
  Plastic       6    3d6        2d6 metres    200
  TDX           12   4d6        4d6 metres    1,000
  Pocket Nuke   12   2d6 x 20   15d6 metres   20,000
  ------------- ---- ---------- ------------- ------------

#### Options

Grenade Launcher (TL 8)
: An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to any rifle at the cost of 1,000 Cr. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload.

Laser Sight (TL 8)
: Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Cr 100. At TL 10, x-ray lasers and improved display technology removes the tell-tale ‘red dot’ of a vislight laser. Cr 200.

Silencer (TL 8)
: A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with Auto 4 or less, masking the sound produced by firing. (–4 DM to detect.) Cr. 250.

Gyrostabiliser (TL 9)
: Stabilisers can be added to any weapon with recoil, reducing the recoil by one point at the cost of 300 credits.

Secure Weapon (TL 10)
: A secure weapon requires authentication in some fashion (scanning the user’s DNA or iris patterns, entering a password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before it can be fired. Cr. 100.

Intelligent Weapon (TL 11)
: This adds Computer/0 to any weapon. Cr 1,000. The TL 13 upgrade adds Computer/1 to any weapon. Cr 5,000.

Vehicles
--------

All vehicles have the following traits:

TL
: The lowest Technology Level that the vehicle is available at.

Skill
: What skill is used to drive or pilot the vehicle.

Agility
: How easy the vehicle is to drive, expressed as a DM to the pilot’s skill check.

Speed
: The vehicle’s maximum speed.

Crew and Passengers
: How many people the vehicle can carry.

Open/Closed
: If the vehicle is open or closed.

Armour
: How much armour the vehicle has. Damage sustained by a vehicle is reduced by its armour.

Hull/Structure
: The number of hits the vehicle can sustain before being disabled.

Weapons
: What weapons the vehicle has, if any, and what fire arcs they are in.

Air/Raft
: An open-topped vehicle supported by anti-gravity technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit but passengers at that altitude must wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably reliable and flexible vehicles.

Ground Car
: A conventional wheeled automobile.

AFV
: A heavily armoured ATV, known as an Armoured Fighting Vehicle, equipped with a triple laser turret. The lasers use the Gun Combat (energy rifle) skill, do 4d6 damage each using the Ranged (rifle) range modifiers, and one, two or three may be fired at the same target with one attack action.

ATV
: An enclosed, pressurised all-terrain ground vehicle. The vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of built-in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint for a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.

G/Carrier
: A grav carrier is effectively a flying tank, and is the standard fighting vehicle of many military forces. The turret-mounted fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of the TL 15 FGMP and uses the same ‘serious firepower’ rules. Advanced containment systems mean that it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the man-portable version.

Grav Belt
: A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted with artificial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to be recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.

Grav Floater
: A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a platform upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It cannot achieve any great speed but can, like an air/raft, achieve any altitude up to orbit.

### Options

With the exception of on-board computer, each of these options can only be taken once on a given vehicle.

Autopilot (TL 11)
: an autopilot has a Computer/1 specialised to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and specialty. This will be in addition to any other computers installed. An autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas (primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level polities may require a slave modification to the autopilot for centralized and/or emergency traffic control. Cr 3,000.

Enclosed
: This modification turns an open vehicle into a closed one. It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and top speed by 10%.

Extended Life Support
: A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle.

Heavy Armour
: Increasing the armour of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the cost of the vehicle.

High Performance
: A vehicle can be made into a high-performance vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50% more.

On-board Computer
: Adding an on-board computer costs the same as a hand computer.

Sealed
: This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is included in the ATV, AFV and G/Carrier). The vehicle can be sealed and provides life support for its passengers and crew for two hours per person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle.

Style
: Allows a vehicle to be customised to the buyer’s wishes. Costs Cr 200 to Cr 2,000.

Spacecraft design
=================

Any class A starport has a shipyard which can build any kind of ship, including a starship with Jump drives; any class B starport can build small craft and ships which do not have Jump drives.

### Primitive & Advanced Spacecraft 

There is a 5% price discount per TL for older technology devices if bought new at the source, to a maximum of –30%. Characters can buy second–hand outdated technology for a fraction of the price (10% to 75%, depending on condition and usability).

The base cost of a hull is MCr. 0.1 per ton, plus a modifier based on the Hull Configuration.

Low Technology Hulls are not as space–worthy as standard hulls, and use lower–grade material. They have lower Hull and Structure values.

High Technology Hulls are constructed using new materials according to the most advanced naval architecture designs, making them stronger.

| TL       |   7  |   8  |   9  |  10  |  11  |  12  |  13  |  14  |  15  | 16 |

The Hull Per row determines how many Hull and Structure points a spacecraft will have at that technology level. Normally, a ship has one Hull point and one Structure point per 50 tons. At higher technology levels, a ship can have more Hull and Structure for its tonnage.

### Configuration 

A ship may have any of three configurations – standard (a wedge, cone, sphere or cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or other lifting body allowing it to enter the atmosphere easily) or distributed (made up of several sections, and incapable of entering an atmosphere or maintaining its shape under gravity).

Streamlining a ship increases the cost of the hull by 10%. This streamlining includes fuel scoops which allow the skimming of unrefined fuel from gas giants or the gathering of water from open lakes or oceans. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it must be included at the time of construction.

A distributed ship reduces the cost of its hull by 10%. It is completely non-aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere or strong gravity it will fall to the surface of the planet. It cannot mount fuel scoops.

A standard-hull ship may still enter atmosphere but is very ungainly and ponderous, capable only of making a controlled glide to the surface. Getting it back into space requires an elaborate launch setup and considerable expense. A standard-hull ship may have scoops for gathering fuel from a gas giant but the process will be much more difficult and less efficient. Larger ships of this type will often carry a specialized sub-craft to perform the actual atmospheric skimming.

Planetoid and Buffered Planetoid hulls cost Cr 4000 per ton to transport from the local planetoid belt and to drill out. Only 80% of the volume of a planetoid hull is useable and 65% of the volume of a buffered planetoid is useable.

A capital ship is divided into between two and six sections, depending on its tonnage. Attacks on a ship will hit one section or another. One section is always the Engineering section; sample names are given for different sections, but the section should be named when components are allocated to it.


### Armour

Armour is added in 5% increments of the ship’s tonnage. (Armour does not need to be added in 5% elements, but it must be added in whole armour point values.)

| Armour Type | TL | Protection | Cost | Max Armour |
|:------------|:--:|:-----------|:-----|:-----------|
| Titanium Steel | 7 | 2 per 5% | 5% of base hull | TL or 9, whichever is less |
| Crystaliron | 10 | 4 per 5% | 20% of base hull | TL or 13, whichever is less |
| Bonded Superdense | 14 | 6 per 5% | 50% of base hull | TL |

For example, a heavily armoured warship might take Bonded Superdense armour twice. This would take up 10% of the hull’s volume and cost 100% of the base cost of the hull, but give 12 points of armour.

#### Capital Ship Armour

  Armour Type         TL   Protection   Cost               Max Armour
  ------------------- ---- ------------ ------------------ -----------------------------
  Titanium Steel      7    2 per 5%     5% of base hull    TL or 9, whichever is less
  Crystaliron         10   4 per 5%     20% of base hull   TL or 13, whichever is less
  Bonded Superdense   14   6 per 5%     50% of base hull   TL

Armour can be allocated on a per–section basis, in which case the cost is determined as if the two differently armoured sections of the ship were different vessels of the appropriate size. Armour does not need to be added in 5% elements, but it must be added in whole point values.

Dispersed structure ships can not be armoured.

Planetoids and Buffered Planetoids have integral armour of 2 and 4 points respectively. They may be additionally armoured as if they were a close structure vessel, but with the base hull already paid for. The maximum armour of a planetoid is 2 plus the limit from the technology or tech level of the armour. The maximum armour of a buffered planetoid is 4 plus the limit from the technology or tech level of the armour.

#### Armour Options

Armour options must be added when the ship’s armour is installed, and cannot be easily retrofitted.

Heat Shielding
: A ship attempting re–entry without heat shielding will burn up. If equipped with undamaged heat shielding, re–entry is successful on easy (+4) Pilot, Ksec skill check, with failure resulting in burn up (this task is often undertaken more slowly). Damage to the ship from proximity to a star in the absence of heat shielding are at the referee’s discretion, but should be harsh! Heat shielding does not provide protection against starship combat weapons; even fusion weapons. Heat shielding costs MCr 0.1 per ton of hull

Radiation Shielding
: Radiation shielding improves the ship’s protection against radiation from both natural sources (solar flares, pulsars) and artificial (nuclear bombs, meson hits). A ship with radiation shielding decreases the amount of rads absorbed by all crew by 1,000, treats the bridge as if it is hardened and provides 6 extra armour points against radiation damage from nuclear weapons, particle beams and fusion guns. Radiation shielding costs MCr 0.25 per ton of hull.

### Options

Armoured Bulkheads
: Adding internal bulkheads requires tonnage equal to 10% of the tonnage of the protected system, but negates the first hit on that system.

Modular Hull
: Up to 75% of a ship’s internal tonnage may be designated as modular, allowing it to be swapped out easily. This tonnage may not include the bridge, power plant, drives or any structural or armour options. Different modules can be installed for different tasks. Making a modular hull increases the cost of the overall hull by the percentage designated as modular.

Reflec (TL 10)
: Reflec coating on the hull increases the ship’s armour against lasers by 3. Adding Reflec costs 0.1 Megacredits per ton of hull and can only be added once.

Reinforced Hull
: For every 10% of the ship’s total tonnage allocated to reinforced hull, the ship gains extra hull points. Reinforced hull costs MCr 0.1/ton.

Reinforced Structure
: For every 5% of the ship’s total tonnage allocated to reinforced structure, the ship gains extra structure points. Reinforced structure costs MCr 0.2/ton.

 Hull Size | Reinforced Structure per 5% | Reinforced Hull per 10% |
:---------:|:---------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
10–90 | 1 | 3 |
100–1,000 | 2 | 5 |
1,000–2,000 | 4 | 10 |
3,000–10,000 | 8 | 20 |
20,000+ | 16 | 40 |

Self-Sealing (TL 9)
: A self-sealing hull automatically repairs minor breaches such as micrometeoroid impacts, and prevents hull hits from leading to explosive decompression. It costs 0.01 Megacredits per ton of hull.

Stealth (TL 11)
: A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams, and also disguises heat emissions. This gives a –4 DM on any Sensors rolls to detect or lock onto the ship. Adding Stealth costs 0.1 Megacredits per ton of hull, and can only be added once.

### Hull and Structure

Initial damage is applied to the Hull; once the Hull is breached, further damage goes to the Structure. When all Structure Points have been lost, the ship has been smashed to pieces. A ship has one Hull Point and one Structure Point per 50 tons of displacement.

For manoeuvre drives, the potential is the Thrust number (Tn), which is the number of Gs acceleration available.

For Jump drives, the potential is the Jump number (Jn), or Jump range in parsecs.

The power plant rating (A-Z) must be at least equal to either the manoeuvre drive or Jump drive rating, whichever is higher.

The standard TL for drives is given in the Drive TL table.

### Drives 

#### Manoeuvre Drive

Reaction Drive
: The reaction drive takes the same space as a gravitic drive, and costs less, but this is offset by the large fuel requirements in addition to fuel used for the jump drive and power plant. To calculate a ship’s fuel requirements, use the following system:

    Fuel Required (as a percentage of the ship’s displacement) = 2.5% x Maximum Thrust x 10ksec of Maximum Thrust required.

    As space combat turns are 1ksec long, each hour of fuel gives 10 turns of operation at maximum thrust. The total reserve of fuel is expressed as a number of G/Turns, which are equivalent to the total number of thrust points available. Each thrust point spent reduces the number of G/Turns remaining in the tank, and a ship cannot manoeuvre once this fuel is spent.

Solar Sail
: A deployed solar sail covers an area dozens of kilometres across. It is made of a flexible synthetic fabric that has limited self–repair capabilities. Particles emitted by the sun – the ‘solar wind’ catch the sail and provide a minuscule amount of thrust. A ship using a solar sail as its primary method of propulsion has a Thrust of 0 and requires several days or weeks to change its course or speed. A solar sail costs MCr 0.01 per ton of ship, and takes up 5% of the ship’s total tonnage when stowed. Obviously, this is ineffective in a p-space combat situation. Ætherdrive can not be used with a sail deployed, but Ætherhooks can be.

#### Æ-Drive Options

Fast–Cycle Jump
: A normal jump drive requires the engine to be prepped before jump, and the ship cannot jump again until the engine has been prepared and the ship’s batteries have recharged. This procedure takes at least 5ksec, and usually as many as 90ksec if all checks are preformed. A fast–cycle drive recharges much faster and does not normally require preparation. After a jump, roll 2d6. On a 3+, the drive does not need a preparation roll and can jump again immediately. However, the time between jumps raises the chance of a misjump.

Time Between Jumps | Misjump DM |
:------------------|:----------:|
< 100sec | –6 |
100sec-1ksec | –2 |
ksec | –1 |

A fast–cycle jump drive costs 10% more than a conventional jump drive.

Stealth Jump
: A stealth jump drive minimises the burst of radiation caused by the transition from jump space into real space. Normally, a ship that emerges into real space will be automatically detected if it emerges within the “minimal” detail range of the sensor. However, detecting a ship equipped with a stealth drive emerging into real space requires a Sensor, Intelligence or Education, Difficult (–2) skill check if within “limited” detail range of the sensor or a Very Difficult (–4) skill check if within “Minimal” detail range of the sensor. A stealth drive takes up no extra tonnage but costs ten times the amount of a standard jump drive.

### Power

Emergency Power
: An emergency power system allows a vessel to keep functioning even when its main power plant has been knocked offline by damage and is a cheaper alternative than a second backup power plant as described on page 106[^:] of the main rule book. If the power plant suffers a third hit, the emergency power system activates, and allows the ship to function normally for 5ksec of full operations – or until it suffers another power plant hit.
: An emergency power system has a tonnage and cost equal to 10% of the tonnage and cost of the main power plant.

Chemical power plants
: A chemical power plant is 40% bigger than its fusion equivalent, costs MCr 1.25 per ton and requires 20 times the amount of fuel for the same endurance.

Fission power plants
: Page 109 of the core rule book (first printing) is now amended. Fission plants provide the same power as a fusion power plant and can provide any power performance level. However, they are twice the size and price of a fusion power plant. They are available at TL7.

Solar Panel
: Extendible solar panels provide backup power for vessel’s power plants. They are sometimes installed in scout or mining ships, giving them greater range and endurance. The size of solar panels required to power a ship is 1/10th that of the main power plant, to a minimum of 0.5 tons. If the panels are fitted to a ship without a power plant, then assume the (non–existent) main power plant is sized to deliver a performance rating of 1. A ship equipped with solar panels consumes power plant fuel at one–quarter the normal rate as long as it is only engaged in minimal manoeuvring and does not fire weapons. Minimal manoeuvring does not include long periods at full thrust, so solar panels are useless for trade vessels. Solar panels cost MCr 0.1 per ton. No power plant fuel is consumed, and endurance is considered as infinite, if the ship is not manoeuvring, using active sensors or refining fuel for use. Jump cannot be entered with solar panels deployed.

Chemical Batteries
: The sizes of chemical batteries are based on the power plant required to deliver a performance rating of 1. A chemical battery the same size as a fusion power plant of the same tech level will provide 1000 hours of use assuming the vessel is not manoeuvring, using active sensors, refining fuel, making significant use of long range communicators or energy using weapons (such as lasers, rail guns, meson guns, fusion guns and particle beams). Alternatively, the same sized battery will give 10ksec of performance without these restrictions. A battery can be scaled in size to give any endurance and costs 4 times the equivalent fusion power plant. A TL7 battery is the same size as a TL 8 battery. The time to recharge a battery is equivalent to the battery endurance used (in low power setting) divided by 1000 then multiplied by 2. If using solar panels to recharge the battery, the “power plant rating” is 0.1.

### Fuel

Fuel needed for a Jump depends on the size of the ship and the length of the Jump and is calculated as 0.1 x tonnage x Jump distance. A single Jump of that distance consumes that much fuel.

The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the rating of the power plant. The fuel amounts listed will power the ship for two weeks, which is the bare minimum for a Jump-capable starship.

#### Fuel Options

Drop Tank
: Military assault ships sometimes use external fuel tanks that are explosively jettisoned as the ship enters jump space. The virtue of a drop tank is that it allows a ship to carry a large amount of extra fuel, but the tank carries a risk. Jumping is a delicate procedure, which is greatly complicated by having big empty fuel tanks flying around in close proximity to the jump bubble.
: Jump tanks come in two parts. Firstly, there are the docking ports, fuel injectors and explosive collars that allow the spacecraft to mount drop tanks and to jettison them quickly. Secondly, there are the physical tanks themselves.
: A drop tank mount costs MCr1 per 50 tons of fuel in the drop tank, and takes up two tons of space per 50 tons of fuel for the fittings to transfer fuel.
: A drop tank itself costs MCr 0.1 per 50 tons of fuel space.

    Jumping using a drop tank applies a –(15–TL) DM to the roll for misjumping (see page 141 in the core rulebook).

    When a drop tank is used, roll 2d6. On an 8+, the tank survives the ejection process and can be retrieved and reused. Otherwise, it is destroyed by the expanding jump bubble or warped by the jettison explosion. At TL14 the use of drop tanks has been improved to such a degree that drop tanks designed at this tech level or above will automatically survive use.

    A ship’s M–Drive rating must be recalculated when carrying a drop tank. For example, a 200–ton ship with a 150–ton drop tank counts as being a 400–ton ship for the purposes of determining its effective M–Drive rating. Round the tank’s tonnage up to the nearest hull size. Drop tanks can also be used to store fuel for other purposes, such as reaction drive propellant.

    The jump performance for the ship is calculated assuming that the drop tanks are not attached unless the jump is to be carried out without jettisoning the drop tanks. In this case, the jump performance should be calculated in a similar manner to the effective M–Drive rating.

    The power plant rating must be calculated assuming the drop tanks are not in place.

    Drop tanks are relatively fragile and if they are attached when the ship is attacked, they are very vulnerable to fire. A drop tank has one hull point and one structure point per 100 tons. Determine the proportion of the drop tank is of the combined ship and drop tank. When the ship is fired on, there is a probability equal to this that the drop tank will be hit, until the drop tank is destroyed. For every point of damage it will suffer hit it will take hull and structure damage as normal and automatically suffer a “fuel” hit as well to the fuel in the drop tank.

Metal Hydride storage
: Instead of storing the ship’s hydrogen in liquid form at extremely low temperature with a high risk of explosion if a leak occurs into the inhabited spaces of the ship, it is possible to store hydrogen in a more bulky form in a room temperature non–flammable metal hydride matrix. Any portion of the ship’s fuel tankage may be designated as metal hydride storage. This storage holds 50% less hydrogen fuel than a more normal tank. It is available at TL9 and costs MCr0.2 per ton. If the storage is hit the following revised damage rules are used:

  * First Hit: minor damage 1d6% of fuel lost
  * Second Hit: loss of 1d6x3% fuel
  * Third and Subsequent Hits: as per normal fuel hit.


##### Burning Your Bridges (or using Jump Fuel in an Emergency)

> Starships have jump drives, which require significant amounts of fuel to sustain a jump. If you have enough jump fuel left it is possible to start to draw on the jump reserve for the Reaction Drive. Each parsec of Jump capability requires 10% of the tonnage of the hull in fuel. Each 10% of fuel will provide an extra 40 Thrust Points of Operations.
> 
> However, each time the fuel is reduced below a 10% increment, the jump range is decreased by 1 parsec. So, if an Cruiser with Jump 2 worth of fuel left in the tanks was forced to eat into its jump reserve, the first fuel used would reduce the range to 1 parsec, and jump would no longer be capable once fuel fell below 10%. This is a risky manoeuvre for an attacker, as this reduces their chance to escape from a system that they have jumped into and attacked.



The Main Compartment
--------------------

The ship’s main compartment contains all non-drive features of the ship, including the bridge, ship’s computer, the staterooms, the low passage berths, the cargo hold and other items.

### Bridge

The size of the bridge varies depending on the size of the ship:

  ---------------------- -------------
  Ship Size              Bridge Size
  200 tons or less       10 tons
  300 tons – 1000 tons   20 tons
  1,100 – 2000 tons      40 tons
  More than 2,000 tons   60 tons
  ---------------------- -------------

The cost for this bridge is MCr. 0.5 per 100 tons of ship.

#### Bridge Options

Command Bridge
: A command bridge is intended for use by warships that will be co–ordinating the efforts of a squadron of other spacecraft. It incorporates a large–scale holographic display of fleet actions, enhanced communications and control electronics, and space for more command staff. A spacecraft command bridge takes up 80 tons, but gives a +1 DM to Tactics (naval tactics) checks. A command bridge costs 50% more than a conventional bridge of the same size. Capital ship command bridges take up 80 tons per section of ship and located in a single location (which may be separate from the main bridge).

Compact Bridge
: A compact bridge crams as much equipment and control stations into as small a place as possible. Compact bridges take up 25% less tonnage than a normal bridge of the same type. However, all skill checks performed on the bridge suffer a –1 DM due to the un–ergonomic design.

Detachable Bridge
: This bridge design can be ejected from the ship in an emergency to become a lifeboat for the command crew. The bridge has two weeks of life support and battery power, while emergency thrusters give it basic manoeuvring capabilities. A detachable bridge is even capable of soft–landing on a planetary surface. Detachable bridges may not be fitted to ships of more than 6,000 tons. See the table below for details of the various types of this bridge.

| - | Type 1 | Type 2 | Type 3 | Type 4 |
|:--|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Ship size | < 200 tons | 201–1,000 tons | 1,001–2,000 tons | > 2,000 tons |
| Tonnage | 15 | 30 | 50 | 80 |
| Cost /shipton | MCr 0.8 | MCr 0.8 | MCr 0.8 | MCr 0.8 |
| Hull | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Structure | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Thrust | 0.1g | 0.1g | 0.1g | 0.1g |

Hardened Bridge
: A hardened bridge is shielded against radiation attacks. The ship’s computer systems are immune to EMP and the number of rads absorbed by the bridge crew is reduced by 1,000. Hardening a bridge adds 25% to the cost of the bridge. If a ship has radiation shielding installed, it is assumed to be hardened.

Holographic Controls
: This bridge design incorporates advanced interactive holographic displays, reconfiguring itself to adapt to the current situation. A bridge with holographic controls is always optimised, and gives a +2 bonus when rolling for Initiative. A holographic bridge adds 25% to the cost of the bridge.

#### Options

Jump Control Specialisation (bis)
: A computer’s rating can be increased by 5 for the purposes of running Jump Control programs only. This increases the computer’s cost by 50%.

Hardened Systems (fib)
: A computer and its connections can be hardened against attack by electromagnetic pulse weapons. A hardened system is immune to EMP, but costs 50% more.

Both options can be applied to the same computer by doubling its cost
(+100%).

### Electronics

A ship comes with a basic communications, sensor and emissions-control electronics suite, but more advanced systems can be installed. The Dice Modifier applies to jamming and counter-jamming attempts.

#### Sensors

Survey Sensors
: Survey sensors integrate a suite of probe drones and deployable satellites into the sensor system, and are optimised for scanning large areas at great speed. Survey sensors are equivalent to Advanced Sensors, but reduce the time taken to scan a planetary surface by one step.

Countermeasures Suite
: A countermeasures suite is specifically designed for jamming enemy transmissions. It is functionally equivalent to an advanced sensor suite, but has a higher DM for counter–measures. Meson transmissions cannot be jammed. The DM for these sensors is +4.

Military Countermeasures Suite
: The military counter–measures suite is the cutting edge of counter–measure technology in the CoreWorlds, incorporating both powerful transmitters and advanced electronic–warfare programs to shut down enemy communications. The DM for these sensors is +6.

#### Sensor Upgrades

Improved Signal Processing
: (TL 11, 1 ton , MCr 4) Improved signal processing provides a +2 DM to sensor tasks and improves of range band of “full” and “limited” by 1 for radar, lidar, densitometer, thermal and visual sensors. However, this comes at a cost of increased vulnerability to jamming, with all jamming DMs doubled.

Enhanced Signal Processing
: (TL 13, 2 tons, MCr 8) As for Improved Signal processing except that it has a +4 DM, the range band increase is two and the susceptibility to jamming has been overcome.

Distributed Arrays
: (TL 11, triples weight and cost of sensor suite and associated signal processing). By using multiple hull mounted arrays in an integrated computer controlled arrangement, it is possible to increase the effective sensor antenna size and increase the longest range of the sensor (all increased range performance is at “minimal” level of detail). Visual and Thermal sensors can now detect at Very Distant Range (from 150,000 to 300,000km), EM and active radar/lidar to Distant range (50,000–150,000km) and passive radar/lidar to Long range. This modification can not be added to standard sensors and can only be added to ships of 5,000 tons displacement or more. Due to their surface area requirements only one sensor suite per craft can be fitted with distributed or extended arrays.

Extended Arrays
: As per the distributed array, but as the arrays are extended well beyond the hull of the ship on retractable arms, there is no limit on the size of the ship. However, with the arms extended the ship can be detected at a +2 DM by all sensors bar NAS and it may not use its manoeuvre or jump drive.

### External Components 

Aerofins
: Extendible aerofins improve a spacecraft’s manoeuvrability in atmosphere only, giving a +2 DM to all Piloting checks made in an atmosphere. Aerofins take up 5% of the ship’s tonnage, and cost MCr0.1 per ton. The DMs for atmospheric operations (see page 137 core rulebook) still apply.

Breaching Tube
: All airlocks include flexible plastic docking tubes that allow passengers to cross from one ship to another by floating through the air–filled tube. A breaching tube is a military version of the common docking tube. Instead of a thin myomer, the breaching tube is made of a combination of ballistic cloth and reflec. The breaching tube does not end in a docking collar, but in a magnetic clamp with a ring of plasma torches that can burn through the hull of an enemy vessel when attached.
: A breaching tube takes up three tons of space and costs MCr 3.

    To use the breaching tube the craft must be adjacent to the target vessel and then succeed in a docking action (see Core Rule book page 147). As the vessel does not have to line up with an airlock, this manoeuvre is easier than using a normal docking tube and receives a +1 DM if the boarding vessel does not want to enter via the airlock.

    If access is acquired via an airlock the plasma torches quickly burn through the airlock and boarding can begin immediately. If trying to get through the hull, the plasma torches will take 1 full turn to cut through, increasing by 1 turn for each 2 points of armour (round down).

    Each breaching tube provides 5 armour against personal and vehicle weapons and 10 armour against lasers. A hit from a starship weapon will destroy the breaching tube if a successful Point Defence roll is made (see core rulebook p149).

Docking Clamp
: A docking clamp allows a spacecraft to carry a small craft or other vessel on the outside of the hull. Recalculate the ship’s Thrust Number by adding the tonnage of the spacecraft and the docked craft together, round up to the nearest hull size, then compare that to the thrust by drive volume table. If performance is reduced to the point that it has no rating, then treat the ship as if it has the equivalent of a solar sail. Jump performance is reduced in a similar manner, but reductions below 1 mean the drive cannot function.
: The size of the vessel that can be clamped depends on the size of the docking clamp.

| Clamp Tonnage | Attached Ship Maximum | Cost |
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:----:|
| 1 | 10–30 | MCr 0.5 |
| 5 | 40–90 | MCr 1.0 |
| 10 | 100–300 | MCr 2.0 |
| 20 | 400–2,000 | MCr 4.0 |
| 50 | 2,000+ | MCr 8.0 |

Grappling Arm
: A grappling arm is a remote–control device for picking up or manipulating objects in space. The arm is a flexible tentacle of thousands of telescoping segments, capable of reaching out up to 250 metres. The arm ends in a set of cameras and grippers of varying sizes, from large claws to tiny micro–manipulators. It also carries a toolkit which can be customised for a particular task.
: A grappling arm takes up two tons of space and costs MCr 1.



### Staterooms

Each stateroom is sufficient for one person, displaces 4 tons, and costs Cr. 500,000. No stateroom can contain more than two persons, as it would strain the ship’s life support equipment. The tonnage and cost of the staterooms includes the life support systems needed to keep the crew alive.

### Low Passage Berths

One low passage berth carries one low passenger, costs Cr. 50,000, and displaces one-half ton.

Emergency low berths are also available; they will not carry passengers, but can be used for survival. Each costs Cr. 100,000 and displaces one ton. Each holds four persons.

### Cargo Hold

The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no cost but cargo carried may not exceed cargo capacity. Any space left over after all systems have been installed may be allocated to cargo space.

### Fuel Scoops

Fuel scoops allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel from a gas giant. Streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in. Adding scoops costs Cr. 1,000,000 and requires no tonnage.

### Fuel Processors

Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel into refined fuel. One ton of fuel processors can convert 20 tons of unrefined hydrogen into refined fuel per day. A ton of fuel processing equipment costs Cr 50,000.

### Luxuries

Luxuries cost Cr. 100,000 per ton, and make life on board ship more pleasant. Each ton of luxuries counts as one level of the Steward skill for the purposes of carrying passengers, and therefore allows a ship to carry middle and high passage passengers without carrying a trained steward on board.

### Ship’s Locker

Every ship has a ship’s locker. Typical equipment carried aboard will include protective clothing, vacc suits, weapons such as shotguns or pistols, ammunition, compasses and survival aids, and portable shelters. The contents of the locker are defined only when they need to be but always contains vacc suits and other useful items. The ship’s locker is usually protected by a biometric lock keyed to the ship’s officers.

### Internal Components 

Armoury
: Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers can benefit from an armoury, a specialised weapons store. An armoury can only be accessed by those with the correct codes (usually the ship’s senior officers and security team) and contains a wide variety of weapons. In game terms, an armoury has enough snub pistols for the crew, enough accelerator or gauss rifles for any marines, and a selection of other military equipment like grenades, combat drug packs, combat armour and communications equipment. A general armoury for a spacecraft costs MCr 0.5 and takes up two 2 tons of space.
: Where military vessels are concerned, the number of armouries built into the ship’s design is based on crew size. One armoury is installed for either every 50 crew members, or every 10 marines, in order to provide adequate storage for equipment, weapons and ammunition.

Briefing Room
: A specialised briefing room is useful on mercenary cruisers and other adventuring ships, where teams can discuss plans or meet with clients privately. A briefing room gives a +1 DM to Tactics (military tactics) checks made when planning missions on board ship. Ships with command bridges and fighter squadrons require additional briefing rooms and facilities. Capital ships must therefore have one briefing room per ship section, and one briefing room for every 20 fighter or bomber crew.

Hangar
: Normally, when a small craft is included in the design of a larger one, it is installed into a form–fitting enclosure in the hull of the mother vessel. The scout’s air/raft, for example, is carried in a small compartment in the forward section, with barely enough room for passengers to scramble on board. Most repairs and maintenance require the air/raft to be launched first.
: Adding a full–scale hangar allows for repairs and maintenance of the small craft when they are back on the ship. The hangar includes spare parts and specialised testing and repair equipment for the stored craft.
: A hangar requires 30% of the space allocated to the small craft, and costs MCr 0.2/ton.

Launch tubes
: Launching and recovering small craft from a larger vessel is usually an activity taking 2ksec to launch or recover one craft. Launch tubes allow small craft to be launched and recovered rapidly from a ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty–five times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deployed in this manner, and they cost MCr 0.5/ton. With a launch tube, up to ten small craft can be launched per round. Multiple launch tubes can be installed.

Laboratory
: Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research and experimentation. Each four tons of lab space allows for one scientist to perform research on board ship. The cost for research equipment varies depending on the type of research undertaken, but is generally around MCr 1.0 per 4 tons.

Library
: A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns, display screens, holotanks and even hard copies of books. A good library is useful for both research and passing time in jump space. Having a library on board a ship doubles Msec spent training for new skills.

Vault
: A vault is a special armoured chamber in the heart of a spacecraft, designed to survive attacks that would annihilate the rest of the ship. A vault has another four Hull and Structure points that only come into play when the ship housing the vault is destroyed. A vault can contain cargo, staterooms or any other internal components equivalent up to 6 tons.

Vehicles and Drones
-------------------

The tonnage and cost covers minimal hangar space, indicating the vehicle is either carried on the outer hull or in a form-fitting compartment on board. For ease of access and for storage of spare parts and equipment, many ships will allocate more space to some vehicles.

Mining Drones
: Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids. Each set of mining drones takes up ten tons, and allows the ship to process 1d6 x 10 tons of asteroid per working day. The tonnage allocated includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay.

Repair Drones
: Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make battlefield repairs with the AutoRepair software or when managed by a character with Mechanic or Engineer skills. Repair drones have the same statistics as repair robots only without an Intellect program.

Probe Drones
: Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces. Each ton of probe drones contains five drones. Probe drones can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting satellites, derelicts and other space debris. They can also be used as communications relays.

Escape Pods
: This covers the installation of rescue bubbles and other escape pods for the entire crew.

Life Boat, Ship’s Boat, Shuttle, Pinnace, Cutter
: These are all small craft, hangared either in or on the ship’s hull.

Air/Raft, ATV
: These are vehicles, also stored in or on the ship.

Armaments
---------

### Changes to Core Rule Book

  * Pulse lasers inflict 2d6 damage and have a –2DM to hit and beam lasers inflict 1d6 damage. Beam lasers become available at TL9. 
  * Missiles are capable of thrust 10, with the turns to impact on page 147 halved (rounded up). However, missiles have limited endurance of 60 minutes (10 turns) before they run out of fuel. 
  * Sandcaster munitions can be constructed with at TL5 allowing low tech worlds to supply some of a navy’s munitions. 
  * Meson screens reduce radiation damage from meson guns and meson flicker weapons. Radiation hits from these weapons suffer a –DM equal to twice the active number of screens. 
  * No launcher includes ammunition in its purchase cost. Missiles, torpedoes and so forth must be purchased separately.

A ship has one hardpoint per 100 tons of ship and each weapon system takes up one hardpoint. A weapon system may include multiple weapons – for example, a triple turret contains three lasers, missile launchers, sandcasters or some combination of three weapons.

#### Advanced Rules for Weapon Bays on Non–Capital Ships

* Standard spacecraft and small craft can always carry one bay but the maximum number is limited by displacement/1000, multiplied by the power plant rating number (rounded down, but with a minimum of one). 
* Meson bays can only be fitted in ships with power plant rating of 5+. Fusion and particle bays can only be fitted in ships with a power plant rating of 3+. There are no limits on the fitting of non–energy weapons, lasers and railguns. If the power plant rating is 3 or 4 a maximum of 50% of turret weapons can be particle beams. If the power plant rating is 1 or 2, a maximum of 25% of turret weapons can be particle beams.


### Turrets

One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the ship. If a turret is installed, then one ton of space must be allocated to fire control systems:

  ---------------- ---- ------ -------------
  Weapon           TL   Tons   Cost (MCr.)
  Single Turret    7    1      0.2
  Double Turret    8    1      0.5
  Triple Turret    9    1      1
  Pop-Up Turret    10   2      +1
  Fixed Mounting   -    0      x 0.5
  ---------------- ---- ------ -------------

Single, Double and Triple turrets can hold one, two or three weapons.

Pop-Up is a quality that can be applied to any type of turret – the turret is concealed in a pod or recess on the hull, and is detectable only when deployed. A ship with all its weapons in pop-up turrets looks unarmed to a casual sensor scan.

Fixed Mounting weapons cannot move, are limited to firing in one direction (normally straight ahead), and are found mainly on fighters. A fixed mounting costs half as much as a turret of the same type, so a single fixed mounting costs 0.1 MCr., a double fixed mounting costs 0.25 MCr., and a triple fixed mounting costs 0.5 MCr.

#### Turret Weapons

  --------------- ---- --------------- -------------------- -------------
  Weapon          TL   Optimum Range   Damage               Cost (MCr.)
  Pulse Laser -2DM     7    Short           2d6                  0.5
  Beam Laser      9    Medium          2d6                  1
  Particle Beam   8    Long            3d6 + crew hit       4
  Missile Rack    6    Special         Depends on missile   0.75
  Sandcaster      5    Special         Special              0.25
  --------------- ---- --------------- -------------------- -------------

Missile racks need ammunition – twelve missiles take up one ton of space.

A sandcaster reduces the damage from a beam weapon by 1d6. Sandcasters require ammunition. Twenty sandcaster barrels take up one ton of space, and cost 10,000 credits.

### Bays

Bay weapons are much larger than turrets, and take up 50 tons of space and one hard point, as well as one ton of space for fire control.

#### Bay Weapons

  --------------- ---- --------- -------------------------------------- -------------
  Weapon          TL   Range     Damage                                 Cost (MCr.)
  Missile Bank    6    Special   Launches a flight of twelve missiles   12
  Particle Beam   8    Long      6d6 + crew hit                         20
  Fusion Gun      12   Medium    5d6                                    8
  Meson Gun       11   Long      5d6 + crew hit                         50
  --------------- ---- --------- -------------------------------------- -------------

Missile banks fire flights of twelve missiles at a time.

Meson weapons are unaffected by armour, as the blast only becomes harmful after it has already passed through the hull. Meson guns also inflict an automatic radiation hit on the crew of any target struck.

#### Advanced Rules for Weapon Bays on Non–Capital Ships

* Standard spacecraft and small craft can always carry one bay but the maximum number is limited by displacement/1000, multiplied by the power plant rating number (rounded down, but with a minimum of one). 
* Meson bays can only be fitted in ships with power plant rating of 5+. Fusion and particle bays can only be fitted in ships with a power plant rating of 3+. There are no limits on the fitting of non–energy weapons, lasers and railguns. If the power plant rating is 3 or 4 a maximum of 50% of turret weapons can be particle beams. If the power plant rating is 1 or 2, a maximum of 25% of turret weapons can be particle beams.

### Barbettes

Barbettes are a weapon mount half–way between turrets and bays. A barbette takes up a turret hardpoint, and uses the Gunner (turrets) skill, but also takes up space inside the ship, as the larger weapons mounted in a barbette need room for capacitors, targeting mechanisms, ammo feeds and other components.

### Large Bay

Large bays are hundred–ton bay weapons, used only on larger warships. They cost twice as much a 50 ton bay. The characteristics of large bays for the bays in the core rule book are as follows:

| Weapon | TL | Range | Damage | Cost (MCr) |
|:-------|:--:|:-----:|:-------|-----------:|
| Missile | 6 | Special | Flight of 24 missiles | 24 |
| Particle Beam | 8 | Long | 9d6 + crew hit | 40 |
| Fusion Gun | 12 | Medium | 8d6 + crew hit | 16 |
| Meson Gun | 11 | Long | 8d6 + crew hit | 100 |

### Missiles

Long Range Missile
: Long range missiles have a smaller warhead to allow them to carry larger engines and travel faster. A long–range missile travels as follows:

| Range    | Turns to Impact |
|:---------|:---------------:|
| Adjacent |       –         |
| Close    |       –         |
| Short    |       1         |
| Medium   |       1         |
| Long     |       1         |
| Very Long |      2         |
| Distant  |       3         |

    A long range missile only deals 1d6–1 damage instead of 1d6. It travels at thrust 15 and has an endurance of 7 turns.

Multi–warhead Missile
: Multi–warhead missiles carry a payload of several warheads. The downside is that the larger payload slows the missile, so it takes longer to reach its target.

| Range    | Turns to Impact |
|:---------|:---------------:|
| Adjacent |       –         |
| Close    |       –         |
| Short    |       1         |
| Medium   |       1         |
| Long     |       2         |
| Very Long |      3         |
| Distant  |       6         |

    A multi–warhead missile that hits its target deals 1d6 damage 1d6 times. It travels at thrust 8 and has an endurance of 10 turns.

#### Missile Types:

Shockwave Missile
: These missiles carry a special magnetic–pulse warhead. The blast is harmless to spacecraft, but it scatters and polarises sand clouds, making them useless. A ship struck by a shockwave missile cannot use sand for the rest of this turn.

Ortillery Missile
: Ortillery missiles are specially designed for planetary bombardment. They are too slow to be used as anti–ship weapons except at Close or Adjacent range.

| Missile Type | TL | Cost/12 (MCr.) |
|:-------------|:--:|---------------:|
| Shockwave    | 7  |          0.035 |
| Ortillery    | 7  |          0.025 |

### Torpedo Weapons

Torpedo Barbette
: Torpedoes are heavy anti–ship missiles (and some navies often refer to them as heavy missiles). Each torpedo carries tremendous destructive force. They can be defended against using standard anti–missile countermeasures. A torpedo barbette fires one torpedo per round, using the normal rules. A torpedo barbette can fit no other weapon. A torpedo barbette costs MCr 4, taking up five tons of space and does not include any ammunition

Torpedo Bay
: The 50 ton version fires three torpedoes at a time. Otherwise this weapon performs as a normal torpedo launcher. The 100 ton torpedo bay fires six torpedoes at a time.

#### Torpedo Types:

Each torpedo takes up two and half tons of space. They are normally purchased in two–shot loads of five tons each. A barbette holds two torpedoes.

Basic
: The basic torpedo consists of a small but powerful engine, guidance computers, and a fragmentation device for kinetic–kill attacks. It deals 4d6 damage on a successful hit.

Nuclear
: Nuclear torpedoes deal 6d6 damage, as well as an automatic radiation crew hit.

Bomb–Pumped Laser
: A bomb–pumped laser torpedo is a one–shot laser weapon. The torpedo contains a small nuclear device that is detonated prior to impact to charge a laser. The explosion destroys the torpedo, but also generates a powerful x–ray laser burst. The bomb–pumped laser is a normal laser attack, but deals 6d6 damage. The basic roll to hit is as a missile, but is defended against as a laser. Point defence can be used, but suffers a –2DM due to the fact the bomb–pumped laser can be used in a stand–off role.

Ortillery
: Heavy ortillery torpedoes are used for bombing fortified positions. They deal 8d6 damage, but are much too slow to be effective in space combat. They move at the same speed as a multi–warhead missile. Attacks made with an Ortillery Torpedo have a –2DM to hit, and Point Defence attacks against the torpedo have a +2DM.

| Torpedo Type | TL | Damage | Cost each (MCr.) |
|:-------------|:--:|:------:|-----------------:|

### Railguns

Railguns can only be used at Short range or less.

Railgun Barbette
: A barbette railgun takes up five tons of space, includes space for 20 shots of ammunition and deals 3d6 damage on a successful attack. Each ton of railgun ammo contains twenty shots and costs Cr 1,000.

Railgun Bay
: A 50 ton railgun bay consists of multiple linked railguns. It always fires in full auto mode, has Autofire 8 and includes space for 200 shots of ammuntion. The railgun bay deals 3d6 damage on each successful hit. The 100 ton version of the railgun bay is as the 50 ton bay version except it has Autofire 12 and includes space for 400 shots of ammunition.

Ortillery Railgun
: This variation on the standard 50 ton railgun bay is also known as a mass driver. It fires larger projectiles at slower speeds that are optimised for smashing planetary targets. The bay includes space for 10 shots of ammunition. A single hit from an ortillery railgun is like a tactical nuclear strike, but attacks against mobile ground targets with an ortillery railgun suffer a –4 DM. Each ton of ortillery railgun contains two shots.

#### Particle Weapons

Particle Beam Barbette
: A particle beam barbette works just like a smaller particle beam turret, but inflicts 4d6 damage instead. It takes up five tons of space.

#### Meson Weapons

Meson Flicker
: A meson flicker 50 and 100 ton bay weapons work like a meson gun, but fires multiple pulses instead of a single meson blast. The meson flicker’s weaker pulses do no structural damage but inflict considerable radiation hits to the crew.

#### Point Defence

Sandcaster launchers are remarkably flexible weapons, capable of carrying different payloads. All sandcaster ammo is stored in standard drums.

Chaff
: Sandcaster chaff disrupts sensors and communications within the chaff cloud. All Comms, Sensors, Remote Operations or missile attack rolls within a chaff cloud suffer a –1 DM. Chaff clouds can be fired at any target within Close range. They do not provide protection against laser fire.

Pebbles
: Pebble canisters are designed as basic offensive rounds for a sandcaster. Pebble round canisters allow the sandcaster to deal 1d3 damage instead of one damage when used as an attack. They do not provide protection against laser fire.

Sandcutter
: Sandcutter rounds fire a hail of electromagnets into the midst of an enemy sand cloud. These magnets cause the sand to coagulate, reducing the effective protection. A successful use of a sandcutter shot halves the protection offered by a sand cloud. Sandcutters are usually fired in concert with a beam attack. They do not provide protection against laser fire.
: Sandcasters are as effective as lasers as long as the missile it is defending against is fired from at least medium range.

### Screens

Screens are defensive systems that protect against specific attacks. 

The number of active screens a spacecraft can support is limited to the power plant divided by 2, rounded up. Small craft can not carry screens. Screens onboard a ship are divided into groups during the design process. The largest group is the primary and another other groups are back ups. The number of screen in each group is limited as above. Screens in each group combine their effect to give multiple dice rolls.

A nuclear damper reduces the damage from fusion weapons and nuclear missiles by 2d6 when affected.

Meson screens block attacks from meson weapons by preventing meson decay.

Instead of decreasing the tonnage of the weapon or screen, it is possible to select upgrades for a higher–technology weapon or screen. One upgrade may be added per extra Tech Level.

Some upgrades are double upgrades, consuming two ‘slots’. An upgrade may only be taken once.

Accurate (Double Upgrade)
: Accurate weapons have a +1 DM to all attack rolls (not applicable to screens). In capital ship combat, if all the weapons firing in the barrage are accurate, a +1 DM is used on the attack roll.

Easy to Repair
: Easy to Repair armaments give a +1 DM to all repair attempts in spacecraft and capital ship combat.

High Yield
: When rolling damage for a High Yield weapon or performance of a high yield screen, any ‘1’s rolled on the dice are counted as ‘2’s. For example, a roll of 1, 1, 2 on a High Yield Particle Beam attack would deal 6 damage, as the two ‘1’s become two ‘2’s. In capital ship combat, if all the weapons firing in the barrage have high yield, a +1 DM is used on the attack roll. High yield screens have no effect in capital ship combat.

Long Range
: The optimum range for the weapon is increased by one band. For example, a Pulse Laser has an Optimum range of Short. A Long Range Pulse Laser has an Optimum range of Medium instead (not applicable to screens)

Resilient (Double Upgrade)
: The first hit on a Resilient weapon is ignored. This only applies in capital ship combat if all the weapons of that type in that section are resilient.

Variable Range (Double Upgrade)
: A Variable Range weapon increases its Optimum Range by one band in either direction. For example, a Pulse Laser has an Optimum range of Short. A Variable Range Pulse Laser has an Optimum Range of Close–Medium (not applicable to screens)

Very High Yield (Double Upgrade)
: When rolling damage for a Very High Yield weapon, any ‘1’s or ‘2’s rolled on the dice are counted as ‘3’s. For example, a roll of 1, 1, 2 on a Very High Yield Particle Beam attack would deal 9 damage, as all the dice are below the threshold and become ‘3’s. In capital ship combat, if all the weapons firing in the barrage have high yield, a +2 DM is used on the attack roll. Very high yield screens have no effect in capital ship combat.

## Construction Time

The construction times for bespoke and particularly military designs is as follows and is based on their displacement:

The first number is for the first ship of that class built in that yard and the second number is for subsequent ships.

Planetoid and Buffered Planetoid hulls cost Cr 4000 per ton to transport from the local planetoid belt and to drill out. Only 80% of the volume of a planetoid hull is useable and 65% of the volume of a buffered planetoid is useable.

A capital ship is divided into between two and six sections, depending on its tonnage. Attacks on a ship will hit one section or another. One section is always the Engineering section; sample names are given for different sections, but the section should be named when components are allocated to it.

### Armour

  Armour Type         TL   Protection   Cost               Max Armour
  ------------------- ---- ------------ ------------------ -----------------------------
  Titanium Steel      7    2 per 5%     5% of base hull    TL or 9, whichever is less
  Crystaliron         10   4 per 5%     20% of base hull   TL or 13, whichever is less
  Bonded Superdense   14   6 per 5%     50% of base hull   TL

Armour can be allocated on a per–section basis, in which case the cost is determined as if the two differently armoured sections of the ship were different vessels of the appropriate size. Armour does not need to be added in 5% elements, but it must be added in whole point values.

Dispersed structure ships can not be armoured.

Planetoids and Buffered Planetoids have integral armour of 2 and 4 points respectively. They may be additionally armoured as if they were a close structure vessel, but with the base hull already paid for. The maximum armour of a planetoid is 2 plus the limit from the technology or tech level of the armour. The maximum armour of a buffered planetoid is 4 plus the limit from the technology or tech level of the armour.

### Drives

To determine the tonnage of the drive required, consult the drive potential table, which gives the percentage of the ship’s total tonnage that must be allocated to the drive to give the designed Thrust or Jump.

#### Drive Potential Table

                      1     2      3     4      5     6

  Jump MCr /ton       2     2      2     2      2     2

For power plants, the required tonnage depends on both the tech level that the ship is built at, and the designed Power Number.

#### Power Plant Table

  Rating              1     2   3     4   5   6
  ------------------- ----- --- ----- --- --- ---

Chemical power plants are 40% larger.

Fission power plants are 100% larger.

TL 8 to 10 fusion plants are 25% larger.

TL 15+ fusion plants are 25% smaller but cost twice as much.

Antimatter plants are the same size and are only available from TL 17.

Cost per ton is as follows:

* Chemical power plants MCr 1.25
* Fission power plants MCr 1
* TL8-10 Fusion MCr 2
* TL11-14 Fusion MCr 2.5
* TL15+ Fusion MCr 5
* Antimatter plants MCr 2.5

The power plant rating must be at least equal to either the manoeuvre drive or Jump drive rating, whichever is higher, unless a chemical manoeuvre drive is fitted, in which case the rating must be 1 or the jump drive rating if this is higher. The power plant rating also determines what weapons and defensive screens of each type in each screen group the ship can carry. There is no limitation on the number of redundant screens fitted.

For example a 60,000 ton TL 15 ship with power plant rating of 5 may have up to 300 bay weapons and a spinal mount. Each of its screens groups can have up to 5 meson screens, 5 nuclear dampers or 3 black globe generators.

  2                Unlimited by power   2 per 1,000 tons   Yes              2
  3                Unlimited by power   3 per 1,000 tons   Yes              3
  4                Unlimited by power   4 per 1,000 tons   Yes              4
  5                Unlimited by power   5 per 1,000 tons   Yes              5
  6                Unlimited by power   6 per 1,000 tons   Yes              6

### Fuel

Manoeuvre Drive fuel
: is only needed if a reaction drive is fitted. The amount of fuel required is determined as the percentage of ship displacement = 2.5 per thrust hour.

Jump Drive fuel
: depends on the size of the ship and the length of the Jump, and is calculated as 0.1 x tonnage x Jump Number, and allows one Jump of the stated level.

Power plant fuel
: depends on the tonnage of the plant. For fusion plants an amount of fuel equal to two thirds of the tonnage of the power plant will power the starship for two weeks.

### Hyperspace Drive

Hyperdrives can be used in non-standard Traveller settings.

A hyperspace drive uses no fuel but requires double the space of a jump drive that can travel the equivalent distance.

### Hull & Structure

Like other starships, capital ships have one Hull Point and one Structure Point per 50 tons of displacement. However, as capital ships are so vast, these Hull and Structure points are divided into several groups, each group representing one section of the ship. If any section of the ship is reduced to zero Structure, the ship is destroyed.

The Main Compartment
--------------------

### Component Options

### Command

A ship requires one command module per section. Each command module takes up 0.5% of the ship’s total tonnage and costs MCr.1 per ton of command module/bridge. One of these command modules must be designated the ship’s bridge, but they can all use any specialist bridge options.

### Computer

  Ship Size Minimum     Jump Minimum   Computer Model   TL   Rating   Cost

The rating for the ship’s computer system is in addition to the processing power and speed needed for Jump Control programs, and all jump control software is included in the price of the computer system. Other ship software must be added to this.

### Sensors

Capital ships use standard sensors. However, due to the size of these vessels, it is possible to mount multiple extended or distributed arrays with up to one per section fitted.

Armaments
---------

### Turrets and Barbettes

A capital ship can mount one turret per 100 tons not allocated to other weapons. The standard set of turrets (single, double, triple, pop–up and so on) is available to capital ships. One ton of fire control equipment is required for each turret.

### Bays

The number of bays that a capital ship can mount is limited by the ship’s power plant (see above), and by the number of hardpoints. The total number of turrets and bays cannot exceed the ship’s tonnage divided by one hundred. One ton of fire control equipment is required for each bay.

### Point Defence

While a capital ship can mount point defence systems like sandcasters, the effectiveness of these systems is measured by the total point defence, not by individual systems.

### Screens

Unlike point defence weapons, which are the same for capital ships as they are for smaller craft, defensive screens scale with the size of the ship. A capital ship will need a larger screen generator to protect itself. Only one screen generator needs to be installed per ship, but extra generators can be installed as backups or to provide a stronger screen. There is a limit on the number of screens that may be combined together depending on the Tech Level of the screens. The limits are:

Spinal Weapons
--------------

The damage of a spinal weapon depends on the size and type of weapon. Spinal weapon damage is measured in capital ship damage terms. For damage to spacecraft, the damage is the barrage value in d6. Spinal mounts use a number of hardpoints equivalent to their tonnage divided by 100. All weapons have long range. A ship may only have one spinal mount.

Increasing Tech Level will reduce size and cost significantly with some improvement in performance.

### Options

Rapid Fire
: A rapid fire spinal weapon is equipped with capacitors and redundant reaction chambers. It can be fired twice in a round instead of once, but only if it does not fire at all in the following round while the capacitors recharge. Making a rapid fire spinal weapon increases the tonnage and the cost of the weapon by 10%.

| E | 12 | 4000 | 400 | 2800 | | | | | |

Components
----------

### Barracks

A barracks takes up 2 tons per marine, and costs MCr 0.1 per marine. Barracks can only be used to accommodate troops intended for boarding or assault operations. Troops accommodated in barracks can not be used to reduce the number of service crew embarked.

### Hangar

Storage Hangars
: have just enough space to hold the craft. To launch or recover the craft takes ten six–minute rounds, as the craft must be unpacked and prepared for flight. A storage hangar takes up tonnage equal to tonnage of the stored craft plus 10% and costs MCr 0.2 per ton.

Standard Hangars
: are large enough to hold the craft in readiness for a quick launch, perform reloading and all necessary maintenance. It includes all the necessary spare pairs, tools and heavy machinery to conduct full maintenance and repairs. A standard hangar takes up tonnage equal to the tonnage of the small craft to be stored, plus 30% and costs MCr0.2 per ton.

### Launch Tubes

Launch tubes allow for small craft to be launched and recovered rapidly from the capital ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty–five times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deployed in this manner, and they cost MCr. 0.5/ton. With a launch tube, up to ten small craft can be launched per starship combat round. Multiple launch tubes can be installed.

Crew
----

All starships require a crew to operate and maintain the ship. In general, the crew of the ship must provide enough personnel to operate all machinery and man all weaponry. The actual number of crew personnel required for the ship must be computed based on the drives, weaponry, and other equipment carried by the ship. It is strongly recommended that you calculate the required crew for the vessel as each element of the ship is designed.

### Command Section

The ship should have a commanding officer, an executive officer, a computer officer, two navigation officers, a medical officer, and a communications officer. The section should also have support personnel, ratings equal to 50% of the total officers in the section. On large ships (over 20,000 tons), the number of personnel in the command section should amount to 5 per 10,000 tons of ship.

### Engineering Section

The ship needs one engineering crew member for each 100 tons of drives installed. This should include a knowledgeable chief engineer, a second engineer, and several petty officers.

### Gunnery Section

The ship should have a chief gunnery officer and at least 1 petty officer for each type of weapon aboard. The major weapon (spinal mount) should have a crew of 1 per 100 tons of weapon; bay weapons should have a crew of at least 2; turret weapons should have a crew of at least 1 per barrage. (Note this places a maximum limit on the number of barrages a ship can shoot, which could limit its performance against small craft. Each operational fighter or turret drone requires at least 1 crew member.

Each screen device (force field, damper, meson screen) should have a crew of at least 4. The gunnery section should have 10% officers, and 30% petty officers. Personnel are drawn from the gunnery branch and the technical services branch.

### Flight Section

If the ship has any launched craft, it should have a flight control officer, crew for each craft, and at least 1 maintenance person per craft. Launch tubes should have a crew of at least 10, which will include a flight supervision officer and a preponderance of petty officers. Pilots must be officers, and maintenance personnel are generally ratings.

In addition, if the ship has more than 3 vehicles (air/rafts, ATVs, and so on), the flight section should include vehicle drivers and maintenance personnel for them as well (at least 1 per 3 vehicles).

### Ship's Troops

Most ships over 1,000 tons have a marine (or military) contingent aboard which ranges in size from a squad to a regiment. Such contingents range from 3 per 100 tons to 3 per 1,000 tons. Ship's troops often fill the role of security forces aboard the ship, and are used for military adventures by the commander where necessary. Ship's troops are also used for damage control parties, manning of some weapons, and boarding actions.

### Service Crew

The ship itself may have a requirement for other sections which provide basic services, including shops and storage, security (especially if there are no ship's troops aboard), maintenance, food service, and other operations. Such personnel are drawn from the crew branch if no other appears appropriate. Allow 3 per 1000 tons if there are no ship's troops. This can be reduced to as low as 2 crew per 1000 tons of ship by replacing service crew with ship’s troops.

### The Frozen Watch

A ship may have low berths installed (and competent medical personnel assigned). If low berths provide enough places for a 50% coverage in personnel (including ship's troops, if any), then the ship has a frozen watch. Replacement personnel are kept available in low berths for continuous replacement of casualties and battle losses; between battles, the frozen watch can be revived and used to restore lost crew.

  Frozen Watch    Varies                                 Low Berth
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

### Quarters

Staterooms or quarters must be provided for the entire crew. The captain of the ship must be provided with an individual stateroom, as must the commanding officers of each section and the commander of the ship's troops. All other personnel on military vessels must be provided with the equivalent of half a stateroom each.

Passengers should be provided with single staterooms. Low passengers should be provided with individual low berths.

Staterooms require 4 tons at a cost of MCr 0.5 per stateroom. Staterooms actually average about 2 tons, but the additional tonnage is used to provide corridors and access ways, as well as galley and recreation areas. Low berths require 0.5 ton per berth, at a cost of MCr 0.05 each.

Section Hit Tables
------------------

Once all components have been selected for the ship, the ship’s details must be recorded and its Section Hit Tables must be laid out.

2d6 | Engineering External | Engineering Internal | Forward External | Forward Internal | Other External | Other Internal |
:--:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
2 | Hull | Crew | Hull | Crew | Hull | Crew |
3 | C | J–Drive | C | C | C | C |
4 | M–Drive | P–Plant | B | B | B | B |
5 | A | A | A | A | A | A |
6 | Hull | Structure | Hull | Structure | Hull | Structure |
7 | Armour | Hold | Armour | Hold | Armour | Hold |
8 | Hull | Structure | Hull | Structure | Hull | Structure |
9 | A | A | A | A | A | A |
10 | M–Drive | J–Drive | B | B | B | B |
11 | C | P–Plant | C | C | C | C |
12 | Hull | Critical | Hull | Critical | Hull | Critical |

All slots must be filled on all tables. The entries marked Type A, Type B or Type C can contain any of several components - see the Component Type table.

If there are excess Type A components, then the excess can be placed in unoccupied Type B slots.

If there aren’t enough Type B slots, use unoccupied Type C slots.

Sometimes, not all of a ship’s components can be placed on the Section Hit Tables; if so, place the largest tonnage components first.

If there are still unfilled slots when all components have been placed, then unfilled internal slots are filled with Structure and unfilled external slots are filled with Hull.

| A-External | A-Internal | B-External | B-Internal | C-External | C-Internal |

[^1]: If the ship mounts multiple types of this weapon (such as laser turrets and particle turrets), they should be counted separately.

[^2]: If the ship mounts multiple types of this component (such as fighters and shuttles), they should be counted separately.

[^3]: The engineering section normally contains all the ship’s drives, but if any drive exceeds 10% of the ship’s tonnage, it should be placed in one extra section per extra 10%.

[^4]: If a ship has a spinal weapon, then it must be placed in the Internal Section Hit tables for every section apart from Engineering.

[^5]: If a component such as laboratories or docking clamps exceeds 1% of the ship’s tonnage, it should be placed on the Section Hit table.

All weapons, sensors, small craft, launch tubes, hangars, computers, screens, command sections and any other component that has a role in ship to ship combat must be put in at least one slot.

Capital Ship Crews
------------------

Crew Strength
: The size of the crew relative to the ship is measured on the Crew Strength scale. An understrength crew may still be able to operate the ship, but with penalties to skill rolls or more slowly. An overstrength crew gives no bonuses, but is able to absorb more casualties and has a bonus during boarding actions.

  Crew Strength            % of full crew   Skill DM    
  ------------------------ ---------------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  Dead                     0%               –          Cannot act
  Survivors                1% to 10%        –4         May only fire once every five rounds
  Skeleton                 11% to 25%       –2         May only fire once every three rounds
  Half                     65% to 50%       –1         May only fire once every two rounds
  Weakened                 51% to 75%       +0          
  Full                     76% to 90%       +0          
  Battle                   91% to 120%      +0          
  Overstrength             121% to 150%     +0          
  Massively Overstrength   151%+            +0          

If a ship is noted as being able to fire once every two or more rounds, then this applies to each individual weapon. For example, a ship armed with a pulse laser bank, a particle beam bank, and a spinal meson gun could fire a half–strength barrage from its pulse lasers together with a meson gun blast. Next round, it could fire another half strength pulse laser barrage and the particle beams, but could not fire the other half of the pulse lasers or the meson gun again.

Crew Skill
: A starship crew is assumed to have average to good Characteristics and to have mastered the following skills: Pilot, Gunner, Discipline, Mechanic, Engineer, Sensors and Medic. All these skills are at the level of their Crew Skill characteristic. Obviously, some individual crewmen will have greater or lesser skills, but the average is the Crew Skill and is used for all skill checks made by the crew.

  Crew Skill    Skill Check DM
  ------------- ----------------
  Green         +0
  Average       +1
  Experienced   +2
  Elite         +3
  Legendary     +4

: A crew may have an especially skilled officer. If the officer has a skill level of 4 or more, he gives a +1 DM to all matching skill checks. An officer may only give a bonus to one skill roll each round, and a skill may only benefit from one officer bonus.

Endurance
---------

Ships are able to operate for one month without needing to go into a spaceport for maintenance, assuming an adequate supply of fuel. This is increased by one month for every 1% of total tonnage dedicated to cargo. If fleet support vessels are in attendance then another three months can be added to the time needed before maintenance is required.

Spacecraft operations
=====================

Airlocks
--------

A ship has at least one airlock per 100 tons. The average airlock is large enough for three people in vacc suits to pass through at the same time. An airlock takes ten seconds to cycle. Under normal circumstances, airlocks are locked down from the bridge and require a Very Difficult (-4) Engineer (electronics) check to override. An unlocked airlock can be triggered from outside. Airlocks generally have vacc suits, rescue bubbles and cutlasses in a ship’s locker nearby.

Ships with cargo space have cargo hatches, allowing up to 10% of their cargo to be transferred at any time.

Atmospheric Operations
----------------------

A streamlined ship is designed to enter a planetary atmosphere, and can function like a conventional aircraft. Pilot or Flyer (winged) checks are required in high winds and other extreme weather.

A standard-configuration ship can also enter a planet’s atmosphere, but is reliant on its thrusters to keep it aloft at all times and is extremely ungainly. Pilot checks are required for all movement and suffer a -2 DM.

A distributed ship must make a Pilot check at a -4 DM when it enters an atmosphere and for every minute of flight. Each check that is failed inflicts 2d6 points of damage.

Boarding, Docking and Landing
-----------------------------

Landing
: Any ship with a standard or streamlined hull may land on the surface. Unstreamlined ships suffer a –2 DM to any Pilot checks made in atmosphere while a ship with a Distributed hull suffers a –4 DM to any Pilot checks, and is likely to take severe structural damage if it lands. Landing at a starport is a Routine (+2) task for most ships taking 10–60 seconds.
: Most ships have landing gear, allowing them to touch down ‘in the wild’, which requires an Average (+0), Difficult (-2) or even Very Difficult (-4) check, depending on local conditions. Non-distributed ships can also land on bodies of water without sinking. Failing a landing roll means that the ship has landed improperly or even crashed.

Docking
: Two spacecraft may dock if they are close together and neither ship attempts to resist the docking manoeuvre. Many airlock designs across charted space are compatible; for incompatible airlocks, ships extend flexible plastic docking tubes that adapt to the target airlock. Docking with another vessel is a Routine (+2) Pilot task taking 1-6 minutes. If one ship is drifting or unpowered, the difficulty rises to Difficult (-2).

Boarding
: Hostile boarding actions are safest when the enemy ship is crippled, in which case it is a standard docking procedure. If the enemy ship is still moving, then the prospective boarders must match the target’s velocity and dock with it (a Difficult (-2) Pilot task), or else just land on the hull and either make their way to an airlock or cut through from outside.

Costs and Maintenance
---------------------

  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Item                Monthly Cost (Cr.)

  Mortgage or Debts   Varies

  Life Support        2,000 per stateroom
                      (3,000 for double occupancy)
                      100 per low berth

  Fuel                500 per ton of refined fuel
                      100 per ton of unrefined fuel

  Maintenance         1/12 of 0.1% of ship’s purchase price/month

  Marine              2,000
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------

Mortgage or Debts
: If the crew are paying off debts on their spacecraft, then these debts must be paid each month. The standard terms for a ship mortgage is paying 1/240^th^ of the cash price each month for 480 months (40 years). In effect, interest and bank financing cost a simple 120% of the final cost of the ship, and the total financed price equals 220% of the cash purchase price. Ship shares are treated as reducing the cash price of the ship, and so reduce the monthly cash payments.

Life Support and Supplies
: Each stateroom on a ship costs Cr. 2,000 per month, occupied or not. This cost covers supplies for the life support system as well as food and water, although meals at this level will be rather spartan. Each low passage berth costs Cr. 100 per month.

Fuel
: Fuel costs Cr. 500/ton for refined fuel, or Cr. 100/ton for unrefined fuel.

Repairs and Maintenance
: A ship needs maintenance, which costs 0.1% (1/1000^th^) of the total cost of the ship per year and requires a shipyard. Maintenance should be carried out each month. If maintenance is skipped or skimped on, roll 2d6 each month, with a +DM equal to the number of months skipped. On an 8+, the ship takes damage to a random system. Roll on the system degradation table for the number of hits.

### System Degradation

  ------ ----------------
  Roll   Number of Hits
  1-3    1
  4-5    2
  6      3
  ------ ----------------

Repair supplies cost Cr. 10,000/ton.

Crew Salaries
: Hired crew members must be paid each month.

Berthing Costs
: Landing at a starport incurs a cost, which varies wildly from world to world.

Fuel
----

Hydrogen is obtained from water or from the atmospheres of gas giants, and refined fuel costs Cr. 500 per ton. Some out-of-the-way places only offer unrefined fuel for only Cr. 100 per ton.

A ship with fuel scoops may gather fuel from bodies of water using hoses. It may also scoop hydrogen from a gas giant. Scooping takes 1–6 hours. Fuel gathered ‘in the wild’ is unrefined, but a ship with fuel processors may refine it.

Jump Travel 
------------

A ship can only safely Jump when it is more than one hundred diameters distant from any object. Gravity can cause a Jump bubble to collapse prematurely, bringing a ship back into normal space early.

### Preparing for Jump

To Jump, the following procedures must be followed:

1. Astrogation: The Jump needs to be plotted. This is an Easy (+4) Education-based Astrogation check taking 10-60 minutes, modified by the Jump distance (thus, a Jump–4 gives a -4 DM to the check). If the check is failed, then the astrogator must plot the Jump again. A Jump cannot be made until the astrogation calculations are complete. Astrogation can be done in advance.
2. Divert Power: Firing the Jump drive is an Average (+0) Education-based Engineer (Jump drive) check taking 10–60 seconds. The Effect of this check aids the Jump roll.
3. Jump!: Roll 2d6 and add the following DMs. If the result is 0 or less, the ship misjumps (see below). If the result is 8+ the Jump is accurate. Any other result is an inaccurate Jump.
* + the Effect of the divert power Engineer check
*-2 per Jump drive hit
* -2 for using Unrefined fuel
* -8 if still within the hundred-diameter limit

### Jump Travel

A Jump carries the vessel a number of parsecs equal to the Jump number. Jumps of less than one parsec (less than three light years, or one hex) are possible, and count as Jump–1 for the purposes of astrogation and fuel expenditure. Regardless of how far the ship Jumps, it always stays in Jump Space for roughly one week (148+6d6 hours).

### Misjumps

A merciful Referee may wish to subject his players to the most survivable form of misjump, where the ship ends up 1d6 x 1d6 parsecs in a random direction.

Life Support
------------

### Radiation

Radiation exposure is measured in rads. Once a character has absorbed a certain number of rads, he will suffer certain effects. One problem with radiation exposure is that while physical symptoms can be treated and may heal, the radiation never goes away. The character’s rads must be tracked. Further exposure adds to what the character is already carrying around until a deadly level is reached. Accumulated rads can be removed using anti-rad drugs.

#### Radiation Exposure

Characters exposed to a radiation weapon will receive a one-time dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area or being exposed to a leak or solar flare will cause exposure each round or hour.

### Suffocation

A spacecraft with power can sustain life support for one person per stateroom for one month comfortably, and for six months at a stretch (number of staterooms x 5,000 person/hours). Without power, this drops to two weeks at most.

Without life support, a character begins to suffocate, suffering 1d6 damage each minute. A character who is utterly without air (such as one who is being smothered or strangled, or who has been dumped out an airlock) suffers 1d6 damage each round instead.

Passage
-------

Passenger travel has been standardised into four overarching categories - high, middle, working and low.

High Passage
: The passenger receives a stateroom and one ton of cargo space for baggage, and can expect high-quality entertainment. Each level of Steward skill (including level 0) allows the steward to effectively look after two high passage passengers on board a ship (so a character with Steward 2 could care for six passengers).

Middle Passage
: Each level of the Steward skill (including level 0) allows the steward to care for five middle passengers. A baggage allowance of 100 kg is permitted.

Working Passage
: This is identical to middle passage but the passenger pays his way by serving on board ship in some capacity.

Low Passage
: There is some danger to the passenger - a Medic check is required upon opening the capsule, applying the passenger’s Endurance DM to the check. If failed, the passenger does not survive. Low passage costs includes a 10 kg baggage allowance; many commercial cryoberth units have a built-in baggage compartment.

The price of passage varies depending on how far you want to go:

  ------------------- ------------ ------------ -----------
  Parsecs Travelled   High         Middle       Low
  1                   Cr. 6,000    Cr. 3,000    Cr. 1,000
  2                   Cr. 12,000   Cr. 6,000    Cr. 1,200
  3                   Cr. 20,000   Cr. 10,000   Cr. 1,400
  4                   Cr. 30,000   Cr. 15,000   Cr. 1,600
  5                   Cr. 40,000   Cr. 20,000   Cr. 1,800
  6                   Cr. 50,000   Cr. 25,000   Cr. 2,000
  ------------------- ------------ ------------ -----------

Repairs 
--------

Damage to a ship falls into three categories - Hull Damage, Structure Damage and System Damage.

A destroyed system costs 2d6 x 10% of its original cost to repair, and cannot be repaired using spare parts.

Hull Damage
: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanic check taking 1-6 hours, and consumes one ton of spare parts.

Structure Damage
: Structure damage can only be repaired at a shipyard, and requires 1-6 weeks per point of damage. It costs 500,000 Credits per point.

System Damage
: A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1d6 hours. Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill check (Mechanic, Engineer (appropriate speciality) or Science (appropriate speciality)) taking 1–6 hours but also spare parts. The Effect of the check determines how many spare parts are required. Spare parts can be purchased at the cost of Cr. 10,000 per ton.

  -------- ----------------------
  Effect   Spare Parts Required
  1        1 ton
  2        0.8 tons
  3        0.6 tons
  4        0.4 tons
  5        0.2 tons
  6+       None
  -------- ----------------------

Sensors
-------

Visual sensors are electronically-enhanced telescopes.

Thermal sensors pick up heat emissions.

EM sensors detect power flows and transmissions.

Radar/Lidar detects physical objects. It can be active or passive. If a ship is using active sensors, it is easier to detect (+2 DM to Sensors checks) but detects more about its surroundings.

NAS detects neural activity and intelligence.

Densitometers can determine the internal structure and makeup of an object.

Security Systems
----------------

Alarms
: If an alarm is tripped (hull breach, fire, door being forced open, alarm button pressed) it will alert the crew. The location of the alarm will be shown on computer displays. The average passenger ship has several crew trained in combat; military ships will carry marines. Some vessels will even have security robots who respond automatically to alarms.

Gravity
: It is possible to alter the artificial gravity on board. Reducing gravity to zero will limit actions to the level of a character’s Zero-G skill. Gravity can also safely be increased up to 3G.

Tranq Gas
: Some ships carry tranq gas canisters in the air vents, which can be released automatically. These flood a compartment with gas that forces an Endurance check each round, with a -1 DM per previous check. Any character who fails the Endurance check is knocked unconscious.

Venting Atmosphere
: If a compartment is connected to an airlock, then the air can be vented from that area. Characters in that area must make a Strength check to hang on and will also begin to suffocate.

Space combat
------------

Each turn in space combat lasts six minutes.

### Setup

If two vessels randomly encounter each other while travelling, the encounter will begin at Very Long range. More often, ships engage near a planet, where the range is Short or Medium.

#### Range Table

  ----------- ------------------------ ------------------ ----------------------------
  Range       Distance                 Thrust to Change   Example
  Adjacent    <1 km                    1                  Docked ships
  Close       1 to 10 km               1                  Nearby vessels
  Short       10 to 1250 km            2                  Ships in same orbital path
  Medium      1250 to 10,000 km        5                  Surface to orbit
  Long        10,000 km to 25,000 km   10                 Near a planet
  Very Long   25,000 km to 50,000 km   25                 Within jump limit
  Distant     50,000 km+               50                 Distant ships
  ----------- ------------------------ ------------------ ----------------------------

#### Weapon Range Modifiers

| Weapon        | Adjacent | Close | Short | Medium | Long | Very Long | Distant       |
|:--------------|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:----:|:---------:|:-------------:|
| Pulse Laser   |      -1  |   -1  |   +0  |    -1  |  -2  |       -3  | Out of range  |

| Sandcaster    |      -2  |   +0  |   -2  |   Out  | Out  |      Out  | Out of range  |

#### Crew Positions

At the start of an engagement, all crew must be assigned to a position on board ship. There can be only one pilot, but other than that, any number of people can occupy the same position.

Pilot
: Flies the ship, responsible for changing course and for evasive manoeuvres.

Captain
: Commands the ship, and can use Leadership and Tactics skills.

Drive Engineer
: An engineer can be assigned to each of the M-drive and the J-drive.

Turret Gunner
: Each turret has its own gunner. A character must choose which turret he is manning at the start of the combat.

Bay Gunner
: Each bay weapon has its own gunner.

Damage Control
: A character assigned to free-floating damage control can repair any system.

Marine
: Prepares to repel boarders, or to board enemy ships.

Passenger
: Passengers are all people aboard ship who are not assigned a position and are assumed to be waiting in staterooms.

#### Automated Positions

The ship’s computer can cover several positions if it is running the appropriate software:

* Fire Control programs can either act gunners or aid existing gunners.
* A ship equipped with repair drones and Auto-Repair software acts as damage control.
* A ship running an Intellect program and Expert Pilot can be the pilot.
* A ship equipped with repair drones and running an Intellect program and Expert Engineer (M-drive or J-drive) can be a drive engineer.

### Initiative

Each ship in an engagement rolls 2d6 to determine their starting Initiative score. The ship with a greater Thrust score gains a +1 DM to its roll.

The commander of each spacecraft (or each fleet, if more than one ship is involved on each side) may a Tactics (naval) check. The Effect is added to the Initiative of the spacecraft (or fleet).

### Manoeuvre Phase

In each manoeuvre phase, a ship can allocate Thrust either to movement (closing or increasing the range to a target) or manoeuvring. The amount of thrust needed to close or open by one range category is given in the Range Table – the number given is the amount of thrust needed to move from that range category to either a closer or more distant one. A ship can spend thrust over multiple rounds to close or open a range category.

If two ships are travelling towards each other, then add together the Thrust allocated by both ships to movement to see how close they are to changing range categories; if one ship is trying to escape from the other then subtract the lower Thrust from the higher value to work out the effective change in position – the faster ship will either gain slightly or pull away slightly.

Any thrust not allocated to movement is allocated to manoeuvring, which is done in the combat phase. Manoeuvring does not change the range to the target but allows the ship to position itself better for an attack or to avoid incoming fire.

### Combat Phase

In each combat phase, a ship may manoeuvre, fire any of its weapons, or board enemy vessels.

#### Manoeuvre

A ship can manoeuvre, dodging and weaving to evade enemy fire or to position itself for a better attack. A ship may make a number of manoeuvre actions per combat phase equal to the amount of Thrust allocated to manoeuvring.

A manoeuvre action can be used to:

Dock with another vessel
: The pilot must make a successful Pilot check. If the other ship does not wish to be docked with then make opposed Pilot checks; the ship trying to dock suffers a -2 DM. When docked, boarding actions can take place.

Help line up a shot
: A pilot may attempt to aid his gunners by providing a stable firing platform along an optimum attack vector. The pilot makes a Pilot check to aid his gunners as per the normal rules on task chains.

Dodge incoming fire
: Any leftover Thrust can be spent as a reaction to dodge incoming fire.

#### Firing Beam Weapons

To fire a beam weapon, the gunner must make a successful Gunner (turret) or Gunner (capital weapons) check, modified by the range to the target. When targeted by a beam weapon, the enemy ship may react by dodging, firing sand or triggering screens (see Reactions). A gunner may fire any or all of the weapons in his turret or bay but each turret or bay may only fire once per round.

If the attack is successful it will inflict damage. Damage is resolved after all attacks have been made in a round.

#### Launching Missiles

Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so hit the enemy vessel almost instantly, missile weapons take time to cross the gulf of space. Missiles travel at Thrust 5 towards their designated target and their position can either be tracked as additional craft in the battle or, for the sake of simplicity, they can be assumed to strike after a number of turns dependent on launch range:

  ----------- -----------------
  Range       Turns to Impact
  Adjacent    -
  Close       -
  Short       1
  Medium      1
  Long        2
  Very Long   5
  Distant     10
  ----------- -----------------

Missiles cannot be used at Adjacent or Close range.

The gunner must make a Gunner (turret) or Gunner (capital weapons) check to determine how accurate the missile launch was. The effect of the Gunner check determines the chance that the missile will strike its target when it hits.

  ------------------------------- --------------------- -- --------------------------- ---------------------
  Gunnery check                   Missile to-hit roll      Gunnery check               Missile to-hit roll
  Failed With Effect –6 or less   11+                      Succeeded With Effect 0     8+
  Failed With Effect –2 to –5     10+                      Succeeded With Effect 1–5   7+
  Failed With Effect –1           9+                       Succeeded With Effect 6+    6+
  ------------------------------- --------------------- -- --------------------------- ---------------------

A target may react to incoming missiles by dodging or point defence. This reaction does not take place until the turn the missiles arrive at their destination, so any manoeuvring or shooting must wait until then.

##### Smart Missiles

The missile to-hit roll for smart missiles is always 8+ and if they miss
they make another attack every turn until they are destroyed with point
defence, jammed with ECM or otherwise dissuaded.

#### Boarding Actions

If two ships are Adjacent or docked, then a boarding action can be attempted. If the ships are docked, then the attackers may cross over safely via airlocks. If the ships are merely adjacent, then the attackers must use thruster packs or small craft to cross over. While crossing, the attackers may be attacked with point defence weapons or by firing sand.

Once across, boarding actions can be resolved using the personal combat rules or the quick boarding rules.

#### Special Attacks

Several types of weapons have their own rules.

Meson Guns
: Meson guns ignore armour and always roll on the Internal Damage table. Furthermore, they also automatically inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage.

Fusion Guns
: Fusion guns inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship’s armour.

Particle Beams
: Particle beams inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship’s armour.

Nuclear Missiles
: Nuclear missile hits inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to their normal damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM equal to the ship’s armour.

Sandcasters
: While the primary purpose of a sandcaster is to block incoming beam attacks, they can also be used as an attack. A sandcaster has a range of Close and inflicts 1 damage.

#### Reactions

A ship may react to incoming attacks. The following situations allow reactions:

* Targeted by a beam attack
* Incoming missile
* Attempted boarding

The ship’s Initiative determines how many times it may react in a round.

  ------------ -----------
  Initiative   Reactions
  0-4          1
  5-8          2
  9-12         3
  13+          4
  ------------ -----------

##### Dodge

Each dodge reaction counts as a manoeuvre and so is limited by the amount of Thrust allocated to manoeuvres. One point of Thrust allows a single dodge. To dodge, the pilot must make a Pilot check. If successful, the attack suffers a -2 DM.

##### Point Defence 

Turret lasers can be used to destroy incoming missiles. The missiles can only be destroyed in the moments before they strike the spacecraft as they are too small and fast-moving to effectively target at greater ranges. The gunner must make a Gunner (turrets) check against the missile. If successful, the missile is destroyed. A gunner may keep making Gunner checks against missiles until he misses an attack; each attack suffers a cumulative –1 penalty. Attacks may be directed against different incoming missiles.

Point defence can also be used to destroy incoming boarders in the same way.

##### Fire Sand

Turrets equipped with sandcasters can fire sand at incoming beam attacks. Each reaction spent on firing sand allows the gunner to make a Gunner (turrets) roll. If successful the damage of each beam in the incoming attack is reduced by 1d6. Resolve each beam separately. Each firing of sand costs one canister of sand.

Sand can also be directed against incoming boarding parties. If the sand attack is successful, each target in the boarding party takes 8d6 damage.

##### Trigger Screens 

Screens can be activated as long as the commander or one of the gunners has the Gunner (screens) skill at Level 0 and the ship has the required screen type (nuclear against nuclear missiles and fusion guns; meson against meson guns). Screens reduce the damage from the attack by 2d6+the operator’s Gunnery (screens) skill. Nuclear dampers also negate radiation hits against crew from nuclear missiles and fusion guns.

### Ship Action Phase

In each ship action phase, a ship may take one ship action. Ship actions are wholly internal to the ship.

#### Repair Damaged System

A character on damage control may attempt to repair a damaged system by making an Education-based Mechanic check. If the check is successful, determine how many hits are repaired:

  ----------------------- ---------------
  Mechanic Check Effect   Hits Repaired
  0                       1
  1-5                     2
  6+                      3
  ----------------------- ---------------

A ship with repair drones and the Auto-Repair software also makes one or two repair checks in the ship action phase (unless it is being used to assist other repair attempts). The standard Auto-Repair software makes the check with a +1 DM.

These are battlefield repairs only and will break down as soon as the battle is over unless repaired properly.

#### Sensor Lock

A ship’s sensors operator may make an Education-based Sensors check to establish a lock on an enemy vessel. Attacks made against a vessel that has been locked onto gain a +1 DM. When using missiles the initial Gunner check gets this bonus–- the individual missile to hit rolls do not benefit directly. Smart missiles are unaffected.

#### Electronic Warfare

A ship’s sensors operator may attempt to jam radio communications and sensor locks by making an opposed Intelligence-based Sensors check against the sensors operator of the opposing vessel. Electronic warfare can be used to break sensor locks.

Alternatively, electronic warfare can be used to attack smart missiles that are targeting the ship. The sensors operator makes a Difficult (-2) Sensors check and, if successful, a single attacking smart missile ceases attacking. The sensors operator may continue making checks to disable smart missiles until he fails one, with a cumulative -1 DM each time.

#### Increase Initiative

The commander of a spacecraft may make a Leadership check and increase the Initiative of his spacecraft by the Effect of the check. This increase only applies for the following round.

#### Change Positions

Any characters not doing anything else may elect to swap positions during the ship action phase. As of the next round they are considered to be manning their new position rather than their previous one.

### Damage

Systems can take a variable number of hits before being destroyed, depending on the system in question. A ship can endure one Hull damage per fifty tons, rounding down. A ship that runs out of Hull Damage will rapidly be incapacitated. A ship can endure one Structure damage per fifty tons, rounding down to a minimum of one. A ship that runs out of Structure breaks up and is completely destroyed.

The effects of damage are determined by subtracting the ship’s armour from the damage rolled by the weapon, then consulting the damage table to determine the number of hits inflicted. Then roll on the Location table for each hit.

A double hit applies two hits to the same location. A triple hit applies three hits to the same location.

  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------
  Damage                         Effect
  0 or less                      No damage
  1-4                            Single Hit
  5-8                            Two Single Hits
  9-12                           Double Hit
  12-16                          Three Single Hits
  16-20                          Two Single Hits, Double Hit
  21-24                          Two Double Hits
  24-28                          Triple Hit
  29-32                          Triple Hit, Single Hit
  33-36                          Triple Hit, Double Hit
  37-40                          Triple Hit, Double Hit, Single Hit
  41-44                          Two Triple Hits
  For every extra three points   +1 Single Hit
  For every extra six points     +1 Double Hit
  ------------------------------ ------------------------------------

Hull
: Reduce the ship’s Hull by one. If a ship’s Hull is 0, then apply the hits to the location in the same row of the Internal Damage table.

Structure
: Reduce the ship’s Structure by one. If a ship’s Structure is reduced to 0, the ship is destroyed.

: Reduce the ship’s armour by one. If the ship’s armour is already 0, then this counts as a Hull hit.

Turret
: A random turret is hit.

> First Hit: The turret’s tracking mechanism is damaged. It can still be used, but all attacks suffer a -2 DM.

> Second Hit: The turret and all weapons in it are disabled.
>
> Third Hit: The turret and all weapons in it are destroyed.
>
> Subsequent Hits: Count as Hull hits.

Bay
: A random bay is hit.

> First Hit: The bay’s targeting mechanism is damaged. It can still be used, but all attacks suffer a -2 DM.
>
> Second Hit: The bay weapon is disabled.
> 
> Third Hit: The bay weapon is destroyed.
>
> Subsequent Hits: Count as Structure hits.

J-Drive
: The Jump drive is hit.

> First Hit: All attempts at Jump suffer a -2 DM to Engineering (jump) checks.
>
> Second Hit: The jump drive is disabled.

: The power plant is hit.

> First Hit: Damaged.
>
> Second Hit: The crew suffer a Crew Hit, rolling on the Radiation Damage column.
>

Psionics
========

Psionic Strength
----------------

Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength characteristic (abbreviation Psi). This characteristic cannot be rolled or bought during character creation without the Referee’s permission. To determine a character’s Psionic Strength, roll 2d6 and subtract the number of terms served by the character in any career (Psionic Strength diminishes over time unless actively used).

Using a psionic talent costs a number of Psionic Strength points, temporarily reducing the character’s total. As the Characteristic DM for all Psionic skill checks is determined by the characters’ current Psionic Strength total, it gets harder and harder to use powers as the character’s strength declines.

Recovering Psionic Strength Points
: Expended Psionic Strength points are recovered at the rate of one point per hour, beginning three hours after the character last used a psionic talent.

Institute Testing
-----------------

The first step is testing a character’s Psionic Strength, which is determined as described above (2d6 - number of terms served). If the character still has any Psionic Strength remaining, he can be trained.

Training requires four months of work, and costs Cr. 100,000. As part of training, the character may attempt to learn any of the common psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making a Psionic Strength check. He may attempt the talents in any order, but suffers a -1 DM per check attempted. If a character learns a talent, he gains that talent at level 0.

  --------------------------------------- -------------
  Talent                                  Learning DM
  Telepathy                               +4
  Clairvoyance                            +3
  Telekinesis                             +2
  Awareness                               +1
  Teleportation                           +0
  Per previous talent acquisition check   -1
  --------------------------------------- -------------

Psionic Talents
---------------

There are several psionic talents, each of which works like a skill for the powers in question. A character trained in the use of psionics may develop his talents over time just as if they were normal skills. Unlike other skills, psionic talents cannot be used untrained. The most common talents are:

Telepathy
: reading minds and mental communication.

Clairvoyance
: perceiving at a distance.

Telekinesis
: mind over matter.

Awareness
: control over one’s own mind and body.

Teleportation
: moving from one point to another instantly.

Each talent grants access to all of its powers - a character with Telepathy 0 can use life detection, read surface thoughts or assault as the situation demands.

### Using A Psionic Talent

To activate a talent, the psion must make a skill check using the appropriate talent (Telepathy, Telekinesis, etc), adding his Psionic Strength characteristic DM and any other DMs. He must also spend the listed number of Psionic Strength points if he succeeds, or one point if he fails. If this cost brings him below zero Psionic Strength, then any excess points are applied to his Endurance score as damage. A character with no Psionic Strength points cannot attempt to activate a power.

Using a talent in combat is a significant action.

Many abilities are ranged. The Psionic Range table lists the number of points to project an ability out to a given range – these must be paid as well as any points to activate the ability. Each talent has a different set of costs, with the exception of Awareness – all Awareness abilities apply to the Psion only.

#### Telepathy

Telepathy is the talent of mind-to-mind contact. It is subtle by nature but can also be used to bluntly crush the wills of those who oppose the telepath.

##### Life Detection

The most elementary form of telepathy is the ability to detect the presence of other minds. Life detection enables a character to sense the presence of other minds, the number of minds present, the general type of minds (animal, human, and so on) and their approximate location.

Life detection is reasonably sophisticated, and can distinguish intelligent beings from bacteria or unimportant animals in the area. It functions best at detecting intelligent minds. Shielded minds are undetectable (whether the shield is natural or artificial in origin). If an individual whom the telepath knows is ‘life detected’ he or she will be recognised.

> Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Easy (+4).
>
> Costs 1+Range.

##### Telempathy

The communication of emotions and basic feelings is accomplished by telempathy. This ability serves well in the handling of animals and beasts of burden but may also be applied as a psychological weapon against humans. Sending of emotions such as love, hate, fear, and others may influence other beings (although not necessarily in the manner desired). Telempathy also allows the emotions and feelings of others to be read by a character. The Effect of the check determines the strength of the projected emotion.

Telepaths will always recognise when someone is using telempathy to bend their emotions but others will not. The change in mood may be dramatic and inexplicable but most people will simply ascribe it to the mercurial nature of human emotions. Shielded individuals are immune to telempathy as they are all other Telepathy powers.

> Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Routine (+2).
> Costs 1+Range.

##### Read Surface Thoughts

The most widely known feature of Telepathy is the ability to read the thoughts of other individuals. Only active, current thoughts are read by this ability, with the subject (if himself not a telepath) unaware of the activity. Individuals with telepathic ability cannot be read due to the presence of their natural shields, unless they willingly lower their shielding. The Effect of the check determines the clarity of the telepath’s perceptions.

> Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 2+Range.

##### Send Thoughts

Complementary to the ability to read surface thoughts is the ability to send thoughts to others. Such individuals need not themselves be telepathic to receive such thoughts. Telepathic individuals are normally open to such transmissions, but may close their shields against them if they become bothersome or threatening.

> Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (-2).
>
> Costs 2+Range.

##### Probe

The application of great psionic strength will enable a telepath to delve deep into the mind of a subject and to then read his innermost thoughts. Questioning can be used in the procedure to force the subject to divulge specific information. The prober can easily determine deliberate untruths told (thought) by the subject. Probe cannot be used against a shielded mind. Again, the Effect of the check determines the clarity of the telepath’s perceptions.

> Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 1-6 minutes, Very Difficult (-4).
>
> Costs 4+Range.

##### Assault

Violence may be dealt by a telepath. An unshielded mind, when assaulted telepathically, is rendered unconscious immediately and the character suffers 2d6 + Effect damage. Unlike normal damage, assault damage is applied to Psionic Strength (if the victim has it), then Intelligence, then Endurance. Psionic Strength and Endurance return as normal. Intelligence returns at the rate of one point per day.

When a shielded mind is assaulted the two telepaths make opposed Telepathy checks. If the attacker wins, the victim suffers damage as normal.

> Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Formidable (-6).
>
> Costs 8+Range.

##### Shield

All telepathically able characters learn how to create a mental shield which protects the mind against unwanted telepathic interference. Shield is automatically in force at all times and requires no Psionic Strength point expenditure to maintain. However, while a telepath has his shield up he cannot use any telepathic powers either. Shield can be lowered to allow telepathic contact or to use telepathic powers – this takes a mere thought (a free action in combat).

#### Clairvoyance

Clairvoyance is the general talent which allows a person to sense events at some location displaced from the viewer. There are several levels of clairvoyant ability. Clairvoyance abilities allow eavesdropping activities as well as spying and detection-free exploration of situations. While telepathic life detection will determine the presence of living minds in a closed room, for example, sense will determine if a room is occupied or empty. Clairvoyant activity cannot be sensed by others, including by other psionic individuals.

##### Sense

The basic ability to sense things at some point in the distance. A character will become aware of the most rudimentary characteristics of a location when applying this ability. For example, the Referee will give a basic description, without detail: ‘a room containing four dogs’ or ‘an open plain with a tree, and no animals or men present’. The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he is applying his talent, and will generally sense the most interesting or important feature at that range. The Effect of the check determines the level of accuracy and clarity.

> Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Routine (+2).
>
> Costs 1+Range.

##### Tactical Awareness

With this ability, the character can perceive dangers and foes around him using his clairvoyant abilities. This enhanced spatial perception allows him to ignore the effects of darkness, smoke, fog or other environmental effects that impede vision. He may also detect hidden foes within range. The Effect of the check how long the enhanced awareness lasts in rounds.

> Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 2+Range

##### Clairvoyance

This specific ability allows actual remote viewing of a situation at some displaced point. Rather than the ‘snapshot’ that sense gives, clairvoyance allows the psion to observe as if he was there in person. The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he is applying his talent. The Effect of the check determines the level of detail perceived and the duration in rounds the vision can be maintained for.

> Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 2+Range.

##### Clairaudience

This ability is identical to clairvoyance, with the exception that it allows hearing instead of seeing.

> Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 2+Range.

##### Clairsentience

This power combines the effects of clairvoyance and clairaudience. The character is capable of both seeing and hearing a specific situation.

> Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (-2).
>
> Costs 3+Range.

#### Telekinesis

Telekinesis is the talent which allows objects to be manipulated without physically touching them. Any manipulation is treated as if the person was physically handling the item but physical danger, pain, or other stimuli are not present. Telekinesis includes a limited amount of sensory awareness, sufficient to allow actual intelligent manipulation.

##### Telekinesis

This basic form of the talent allows the character to move objects at range. The Effect of the check determines the duration of the telekinesis in rounds. The number of points spent determines the Strength of the Telekinesis.

> Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs Strength+Range.

##### Flight

By applying telekinesis to his own body the character can fly, or at least levitate over short distances. The character can fly for a number of rounds equal to the Effect of the check at a speed of six metres per round.

> Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
> Costs 5.

##### Telekinetic Punch

Telekinesis can be used as a direct attack, smashing the foe with a blast of telekinetic force. The damage inflicted is 2d6 + the Effect\ of the check.

> Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 1+Range.

##### Microkinesis

This more challenging form of telekinesis allows for fine manipulation of very small or even microscopic objects. A telekinetic can use this power to pick locks, perform microsurgery, sabotage a computer system and so forth. The range is always Personal.

> Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
>
> Costs 3.

##### Pyrokinesis

By exciting the substance of an object the character can raise its temperature, possibly even causing it to burst into flames. Roll 1d6 and add the Effect of the check.

  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  Pyrokinesis Effect   Target…
  0-4                  Becomes warmer, but is undamaged.
  5-8                  Is burned, suffering 1d6 damage.
  9+                   Suffers 2d6 damage and may burst into flame if flammable.
  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------

> Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (-2).
>
> Costs 3+Range.

#### Awareness

Awareness is the psionic talent which allows control of one’s own body. Awareness powers never have a range – they are used only on yourself.

##### Suspended Animation

Personal body activity may be suspended for varying periods of time. A character with Awareness may enter a suspended animation state (similar to cold sleep but without the intrinsic danger of death) by willing himself into it. Such a state continues for 7 days without need for food or water and with minimal air needs. Such a person could effectively travel in a low passage berth without actually undergoing cold sleep and its dangers. Suspended animation may be stopped at any time previous to its duration expiring, provided external stimulus is given to awaken the sleeper (such as a friend or a mechanical alarm).

> Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 minutes, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 3.

##### Enhanced Awareness

By focussing his mind, the character can improve his concentration and ability to perform complex tasks. While under the effects of enhanced awareness, the character may add his Psionic Strength DM (if positive) to any skill checks. Enhanced awareness lasts until the character fails a skill check or sleeps.

> Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs 1.

##### Psionically Enhanced Strength

Psionic Strength points may be converted to normal Strength points on a temporary basis. The character makes the commitment, reduces his Psionic Strength by a specific number of points, and increases his physical Strength characteristic by that number. In no case may the number of Strength points gained exceed the character’s current level in Awareness, and Strength may not be increased beyond the character’s racial maximum. Psionically enhanced strength reaches its new level immediately, remains at that peak for ten minutes, and then declines at the rate of 1 Strength point per minute until the normal Strength level is reached. This power works as normal on wounded characters but their Strength returns to the wounded level rather than the normal value. It cannot be used as a ‘quick heal’.

> Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs boosted Strength.

##### Psionically Enhanced Endurance

Psionically enhanced endurance works in exactly the same way as psionically enhanced strength except the characteristic boosted is Endurance rather than Strength, including its lack of healing ability.

> Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
>
> Costs boosted Endurance.

##### Regeneration

Wounds and injuries may be healed rapidly. Strength, Dexterity and Endurance lost to injury, disease, poison or other trauma may be healed by the application of this ability, exchanging one Psionic Strength point to regenerate one characteristic point. Any amount of Psionic Strength may be expended with a single use of regeneration but it may not be used again until all expended Psionic Strength is recovered. Regeneration may also be applied to the growing of new limbs or organs to replace lost ones or to heal unrecovered old wounds suffered prior to psionic training. Regeneration may not be used to counteract aging. Awareness is not capable of affecting others and may not be used for healing or enhancing other characters.

> Awareness, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Very Difficult (-4).
>
> Costs amount healed.

##### Body Armour

By channelling psionic strength to his skeletal structure and boosting his healing rate, the character can enhance his ability to absorb damage. Body armour lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Effect of the check and provides an armour rating equal to the number of Psionic Strength points expended. This armour stacks with worn armour as normal.

> Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Very Difficult (–4).
>
> Costs amount healed.

#### Teleportation

Teleportation is a talent which allows effectively instantaneous movement from one point to another point without regard to intervening matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement of the teleported character’s body and (for highly skilled teleporters) his or her clothing and weapons.

Unlike the other talents, Teleportation has only a single power: the ability to teleport yourself. Teleporting without any equipment or clothing uses the Teleportation talent with the Psionic Strength DM as a modifier. The act of teleporting takes 1-6 seconds (a significant action in combat) and costs nothing except what the psion spends on range.

* Teleporting with up to 10 kg of equipment or clothing is Difficult (-2 DM) and costs 2 + range Psionic Strength points.
* Teleporting with up to 500 kg of equipment is Very Difficult (-4 DM) and costs 4 + range Psionic Strength points.

Teleportation always involves the movement of one’s body to another location. Independent items or other individuals may not be moved. Teleportation involves certain requirements in order to be accurate, and to insure obedience of the laws of physics.

Preknowledge of Destination
: A character must always have a mental image of his or her destination before teleporting. This mental image is acquired by personally visiting the location first (or viewing it from a distance), having the mental image implanted in one’s mind (by telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination, or by viewing the location through clairvoyance. The key to remember is that someone has to actually view the location – recorded images are not enough.

##### Energy and Momentum

Teleportation involves serious restrictions on movement in order to assure the conservation of energy and momentum.

On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to jumps of Very Distant range or less. Jumps at Very Distant range involve disorientation for a period of 20 to 120 seconds (2d6 x 10) after arrival. This restriction results from the law of conservation of momentum: on a rotating planet, two locations will have different rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a point on the Earth’s equator to one of its poles would result in a total velocity difference between the character and his surroundings of over 3300 kph, which would lead to a messy death in short order.

Teleporting to or from vehicles travelling at high speed can also result in energy gains or losses. When teleporting into, onto or out of a fast-moving vehicle the psion takes damage as if the vehicle had rammed him at its current speed.

Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations of differing gravitational potential) will result in potential energy changes, manifesting themselves as changes in body temperature. A jump of one kilometre straight down will result in a temperature increase of 2.5 degrees Celsius; this is sufficient to cause extreme fever, brain damage, and even death. A jump up will cool the body by the same amount, with equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not involve an elevation change of more than 400 meters, and multiple jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change or more than 600 meters in one hour. These problems may be gotten around through the use of technological devices: energy compensators, heated suits, and other means. Characters may feel driven to invent such materials, commission their invention, or seek them out from those who already have them.

Psionic Technology
------------------

Psi-Drugs (TL 8+)
: These drugs restore Psionic Strength if taken when the character has already spent Psionic Strength points, or temporarily increase the character’s Psionic Strength if taken when he is at full Psionic Strength.

  ---------- ---- --------------------------- -------------------------- ------------
  Drug       TL   Psionic Strength Restored   Psionic Strength Boosted   Cost (Cr.)
  Standard   8    3                           2                          1,000
  Double     9    6                           4                          4,000
  Special    10   9                           6                          10,000
  ---------- ---- --------------------------- -------------------------- ------------

: A character who takes more than one dose of Standard or Double Psi-Drug, or a single dose of the Special drug must make an Endurance check, with a -1 DM per dose of psi-drug taken in the last week (not including the one just taken). If the check is failed the character falls ill with a serious fever, suffering 3d6 damage and permanently reducing his Psionic Strength by one.

Inhibitor Drug (TL 9)
: Psionic inhibitors dampen the brain’s ability to generate psychic effects. A character who takes (or, more often, is forcibly injected with) an inhibitor drug suffers a –4 DM to all Psionic Strength checks and cannot regain Psionic Strength points. Each hour the character may make an Endurance check to throw off the effects of the drug with a +1 DM for every previous check. Inhibitor drugs have no effect on non-psionic individuals. The drugs cost\ Cr. 500 per dose.

Psionic Shield (TL 12)
: Any armour incorporating a helmet or hood can be outfitted with a psionic shield, blocking Telepathy. Unlike the Telepathy power shield a technological shield is invulnerable to assault and blocks send thoughts. It cannot be lowered without removing the helmet or hood containing the shield. Cr. 40,000.
: Buildings and vehicles can also be psionically shielded, but this is much more costly, increasing the cost by 10%.

Teleportation Suit (TL 12)
: This device can be integrated into a suit of armour or worn as a form-hugging body-suit. It rapidly cools or warms the body after a teleport, minimising the damage from sudden energy gains or losses. The suit costs Cr. 50,000 and allows a character to jump up to 600 metres up or down in a single teleport, or up to ten kilometres in a single hour when using successive jumps.

Psionic Interface (TL 14)
: Any weapon or technological device can be outfitted with a psionic interface. A character using a device with a psionic interface can use his Psionic Strength DM instead of his Dexterity DM when using the weapon or device; a character without psionic ability cannot use the device. The character must either touch the device or use telekinesis to interact with it at range. Adding a psionic interface increases the cost of the device by 20%.

Trade
=====

Freight 
--------

Freight shipments pay Cr. 1,000 per ton for shipping a ton for one parsec, +200 Cr. per additional parsec. Freight lots must be transported in their entirety, and come in three sizes:

* Major cargos are composed of 1d6 x 10 tons of freight.
* Minor cargos are composed of 1d6 x 5 tons of freight.
* Incidental cargos are composed of 1d6 tons of freight.

To determine the number of cargos available, add the destination planet’s Population value to the modifiers from the Freight Traffic table, then consult the Freight Lots Available table.

A freight lot cannot be broken up. Cargo is paid for upon delivery, assuming it is delivered on time. Failing to deliver cargo on time reduces the amount paid by 1d6+4 x 10%.

### Mail

Mail is a special form of freight, consisting of large data storage drums which contain a vast amount of information that must be transported from one world to another, but is not vital enough to be entrusted to the X-Boat service or a private courier. To determine if there is mail available, determine the applicable Mail DMs, then roll on the available mail table.

#### Mail Dice Modifiers 

  Freight Traffic modifier of -10 or more: -2 DM

 Freight Traffic modifier of -9 to -5: -1 DM

 Freight Traffic modifier of -4 to +4: +0 DM

 Freight Traffic modifier of 5 to 9: +1 DM

 Freight Traffic modifier of 10+: +2 DM

 Characters’ ship is armed: +2 DM

 + characters’ highest Naval or Scout rank

 + characters’ highest Social Standing DM

 World has a TL of 5 or less: -4

Roll 2d6. On a 12 or more, after modifiers, the characters can transport mail to the destination world. A mail container takes up five tons of space and the characters will be paid Cr. 25,000 for transporting the mail.

Speculative Trade and Smuggling
-------------------------------

### Finding a Supplier

Characters can search for multiple suppliers, but there is a –1 DM per previous attempt on a planet in a given month.

Finding a supplier
: Broker, Education or Social Standing, 1-6 days, Average (+0).

Finding a black market supplier
: (Illegal goods only) Streetwise, Education or Social Standing, 1-6 days, Average (+0).

Finding an online supplier
: (Worlds with TL 8+ only) Computers, Education, 1–6 hours, Average (+0).

The size of the Starport provides a bonus to finding a supplier. Class A starports give a +6 DM, class B starports give a +4 DM and class C
starports give a +2 DM.

### Determine Goods Available

Goods are divided into two categories of goods - Common and Trade Goods. Common Goods can be purchased on any world. Trade Goods can usually only be found on a world with a matching trade code. The amount of each type of goods available is limited – the tons column determines how many tons of a given type of goods are available for purchase.

A given supplier has all Common Goods available, the Trade Goods that match the world’s trade code, and 1d6 randomly determined goods. Roll d66 on the table to determine the goods available, ignoring results 61-65 unless dealing with a black market supplier. If you roll the same type of goods multiple times, then the supplier has extra amounts of those goods available.

Some goods are illegal, and can be purchased only through a black market supplier. A black market supplier has whatever illegal goods match his world’s trade code, as well as any randomly rolled illegal goods.

### Determine Purchase Price

To determine the purchase price, roll 3d6 and apply the following
modifiers:

 \+ the character's Broker skill (or the local broker’s skill).

 \+ the character’s Intelligence or Social Standing DM, whichever is
higher.

 \+ the largest Dice Modifier from the Purchase DM column.

 \- the largest Dice Modifier from the Sale DM column.

 \- any Dice Modifiers from the supplier. Some especially rich or powerful suppliers can demand high prices.

In cases where multiple Purchase or Sale DMs apply, use only the largest ones from each column.

Next, consult the Purchase column of the Modified Price table. The trader does not have to accept this price, but if he rejects the deal, then he cannot deal with that supplier again for at least one week. After that week, he may reroll one of the dice thrown to determine the purchase price for those goods.

### Selling Goods

Selling goods works just like purchasing goods, with the following changes:

* A character must find a buyer, instead of a supplier. The same rules
apply.
* When selling goods, add the largest Sale DMs for the world trade code
and subtract the largest Purchase DMs.
* If a character does not accept the price offered for his goods, he must find another buyer or wait a week, in which case he may reroll one of the dice thrown to determine the purchase price.

World creation
==============

World Occurrence
: There is a basic one-half chance normally that a world(and its attendant stellar system) will be in a hex. Systematically check each hex on the subsector map, throwing one die and marking the hex with a circle if the result is a 4, 5, or 6. This indicates that a world is present; otherwise, leave the hex blank.
: The Referee may elect to alter the normal chances of worlds, making them more frequent or less frequent to correspond to specific regions of the galaxy. A 50% density (no DM) is appropriate for the spiral arms of the galaxy. Apply a -2 DM for ‘rift sectors’, a -1 DM for sparse sectors and a +1 DM for densely populated sectors.

Starport Type
: Many worlds have starports, their presence being essential to interstellar trade and commerce.

Bases
: Stellar systems may have bases for military forces, the navy, the scouts, or for other arms of interstellar government.
: Bases will also help determine political boundaries in the sector. An interstellar government will place bases along its borders to guard against aggression from rival states, or to control local systems. The presence of multiple bases within a few parsecs might indicate a contested border, or a mighty stronghold.

Gas Giants
: A star system may have one or more gas giant planets. The presence of a gas giant allows starships equipped with fuel scoops to refuel by skimming; this eliminates fuel cost for the vessel and increases profit. It also allows refuelling at systems that do not have starports. Refuelling in this fashion requires 1-6 hours per 40 tons of fuel.
: Gas giants are relatively common. For each system throw 10+ on 2d6 for at least one gas giant not to be present in the system.

Travel Zones
: Most worlds are assumed to be civilized, or at least amenable to travellers and visitors. Some, however, are caught in the throes of war, plagued by disease, or simply not ready for interstellar visitors. Such worlds are classified by travel zones to denote such status. In most cases, the Referee should indicate travel zones based on the information available. Two such zone types exist: amber and red.

Polities
: Worlds may be independent, or part of a larger polity that spans a system or more. Polities range from loose confederations of a few worlds with common trade or defence policies or cultural links, to vast star empires containing thousand of systems and trillions of citizens. Polity borders should be drawn on the map. Note that larger polities will usually have sub-domains, which should also be marked.

Communications Routes
: Within the subsector, local governments will have established communications routes connecting some (but not all) worlds. These routes serve as a conduit for messages between businesses and between governments as well as between people.
: Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as to avoid making all parts of the subsector accessible; a subsector should have some areas as backwaters for exploration and adventure. Communications routes are drawn as single lines connecting hexes on the subsector grid.

Trade Routes
: Trade routes link worlds that have strong commercial ties. Consult the table below - if any pair of worlds matching the two columns are within four parsecs of each other, and there is a Jump–1 or Jump–2 route between them, then mark a trade route connecting those two worlds.

  ------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Column 1                  Column 2

  Industrial or High Tech   Asteroid, Desert, Ice Capped,
                            Non-Industrial

  ------------------------- -----------------------------------

World Creation
--------------

The basic planetary characteristics are Size, Atmosphere, Hydrology, Population, Government, Law Level, Technology Level, Starport and Bases, and are generated using two-dice throws, with DMs applied based on other characteristics. These characteristics establish the basic identity of a world, and are referred to as the Universal World Profile (UWP). Additional information can be generated, and should be, to more fully describe a world.

### Size

The Size characteristic for inhabitable worlds ranges from 0 to 10, and is determined by rolling 2d6-2.

#### Size Table

  -------- ------------ ----------------------
  Digit    World Size   Surface Gravity (gs)
  0        800 km       Negligible
  1        1,600 km     0.05
  2        3,200 km     0.15
  3        4,800 km     0.25
  4        6,400 km     0.35
  5        8,000 km     0.45

  9        14,400 km    1.25
  10 (A)   16,000 km    1.4
  -------- ------------ ----------------------

#### High and Low Gravity Worlds

Worlds where the gravity is 0.75 or less are low-gravity worlds. Common features include improbable-looking rock formations, thin and spindly life forms and flying as a common form of locomotion (assuming the atmosphere is thick enough to support flyers). Humans tend to find life on low-gravity worlds to be initially pleasant, but regular exercise regimes and medicinal supplements are required to prevent bone and muscle degradation. Those who spent too long on low-gravity worlds cannot tolerate higher gravities. Characters on low-gravity worlds suffer a -1 DM to all skill checks until they acclimatise, a process which takes 1d6 weeks. Characters with the Zero-G skill at level 0 or better acclimatise instantly.

High-gravity worlds have a gravity 1.25 times or more than of Earth. They tend to be extremely dense worlds; common features include wide rocky plains, squat, muscular creatures, and plant life that spreads out like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling, burrowing or swimming are the commonest forms of locomotion. Humans find high-gravity worlds unpleasant. Especially high-gravity worlds require the use of pressured or powered suits to support the human frame. Characters on high-gravity worlds suffer a -1 DM to all skill checks until they acclimatise, a process which takes 1d6 weeks.

### Atmosphere

A planet’s Atmosphere is generated by rolling 2d6-7 and adding the planet’s Size.

#### Atmosphere Types

Tainted
: Tainted atmospheres contain some element that is harmful to humans, such as an unusually high proportion of carbon dioxide. A character who breathes a tainted atmosphere without a filter will suffer 1d6 damage every few minutes (or hours, depending on the level of taint).

Exotic
: An exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by humans, but is not otherwise hazardous. A character needs an air supply to breath in an exotic atmosphere.

Corrosive
: Corrosive atmospheres are highly dangerous. A character who breathes in a corrosive atmosphere will suffer 1d6 damage each round.

Insidious
: An insidious atmosphere is like a corrosive one, but it is so corrosive that it attacks equipment as well. The chief danger in an insidious atmosphere is that the toxic gases will destroy the seals and filters on the character’s protective gear. An insidious atmosphere worms its way past protection after 2d6 hours on average, although vigilant maintenance or advanced protective gear can prolong survival times.

  14 (E)   Thin, Low            0.5 or less     
  15 (F)   Unusual              Varies          Varies
  -------- -------------------- --------------- ------------------------

Dense, High (D)
: These worlds have thick N2/O2 atmospheres, but their mean surface pressure is too high to support unprotected human life (high pressure nitrogen and oxygen are deadly to humans). However, pressure naturally decreases with increasing altitude, so if there are highlands at the right altitude the pressure may drop enough to support human life. Alternatively, there may not be any topography high enough for humans to inhabit, necessitating floating gravitic or dirigible habitats or sealed habitats on the surface.

Thin, Low (E)
: The opposite of the Dense, High atmosphere, these massive worlds have thin N2/O2 atmospheres that settle in the lowlands and depressions and are only breathable there – the pressure drops off so rapidly with altitude that the highest topographic points of the surface may be close to vacuum.

Unusual (F)
: An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an atmosphere that behaves in a strange manner. Examples include ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and dense at the equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded by a water layer hundreds of kilometres thick; worlds wracked by storms so intense that that the local air pressure changes from dense to thin depending on the current wearther; and other planets with unusual and hazardous atmospheric conditions.

### Hydrographics

Hydrographic percentage is obtained by rolling 2d6-7 and adding the planet’s Size, modified by the planet’s atmosphere or size as described below:

  ---------------------------- -----------------
  Size 0 or 1                  Hydrographics 0
  Atmosphere 0, 1, A, B or C   –4
  ---------------------------- -----------------

If the planet’s atmosphere is not D (or a kind of F that is thick enough to retain water) then also apply DMs for temperature:

  ---------------------- ----
  Hot Temperature        –2
  Roasting Temperature   –6
  ---------------------- ----

#### Hydrographics Table

  -------- ------------------------- --------------------------------------------
  Digit    Hydrographic Percentage   Description
  0        00%-05%                   Desert world

  2        16%-25%                   A few small seas.
  3        26%-35%                   Small seas and oceans.
  4        36%-45%                   Wet world
  5        46%-55%                   Large oceans
  6        56%-65%                   
  7        66%-75%                   Earth-like world
  8        76%-85%                   Water world
  9        86%-95%                   Only a few small islands and archipelagos.
  10 (A)   96%-100%                  Almost entirely water.
  -------- ------------------------- --------------------------------------------

### Population

Population is generated by rolling 2d6-2:

#### Population Table

  -------- ----------------------- -------------------- -------------------------------------
  Digit    Population              Range                Description

  -------- ----------------------- -------------------- -------------------------------------

If a world has a population of 0, it is uninhabited and so has a Government, Law Level and Technology Level of 0.

### Government 

The Government characteristic is determined by rolling 2d6-7 and adding the planet’s Population.

#### Rivals, Factions, Connections and Colonies

Roll 1d3 to determine how many factions there are on the planet, with a DM of +1 if the government type is 0 or 7, and a DM of -1 if the government type is 10 or more. Determine what ‘mini-government’ each faction uses on the government table. In cases where the faction type is the same as the current government type, then it is a splinter faction within the ruling government. In cases where it is radically different, then the faction is a rebel group or movement.

Roll 2d6 to determine the strength of each faction:

##### Faction Strength Table

  ------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Roll    Relative Strength
  1-3     Obscure group - few have heard of them, no popular support
  4-5     Fringe group - few supporters
  6-7     Minor group - some supporters
  8-9     Notable group - significant support, well known
  10-11   Significant - nearly as powerful as the government
  12      Overwhelming popular support - more powerful than the government
  ------- ------------------------------------------------------------------

### Law Level

Law level is determined by rolling 2d6-7 and adding the Government characteristic.

#### Illegal Possessions

|  9+   | Any weapons | All drugs | Any data from offworld. No free press. | TL 3 items | No offworlders permitted | All psionics |

#### The Law and Travellers

In each of the following situations, roll 2d6, add the listed modifiers, and if the total is lower than the planet’s Law Level, the characters are investigated or challenged by agents of planetary law enforcement.

  -------------------------------------------------------------- ---- -------------
  Situation                                                      DM   Response
  First approach to a planet                                     +0   Check
  Offworlders wandering the streets of a city (once per day)     +0   Check
  Offworlders acting suspiciously                                -1   Check
  Bar fight                                                      -1   Combat
  Shots fired                                                    -2   Combat
  Breaking and entering                                          -2   Investigate
  Firefight involving armoured characters and military weapons   -4   Combat
  Murder and carnage                                             -4   Investigate
  -------------------------------------------------------------- ---- -------------

Check
: the characters’ travel documents and identities are checked, either by a police officer or guard, or by electronically by querying the characters’ comms. A successful Admin or Streetwise roll can allay suspicion but if this check is failed the planetary authorities move on to Investigation.

Investigate
: a detective or bureaucrat probes deeper into the characters’ backgrounds. If the characters have a ship, it will be searched. They may be followed, or have their communications tapped. They may also be questioned closely.

Combat
: the police show up ready for a fight. Their response will generally be proportional to the threat posed by the player characters; if the characters are just making trouble in a bar, then most police forces will just use batons, stunners, tranq gas and other non-lethal weapons. On the other hand, if the characters are in Battle Dress and firing PGMPs at the palace of the planetary duke, then the police will show up with the best weapons and armour available at the planet’s TL (or even a few levels higher).

Characters arrested for a crime will face punishment, determined by rolling 2d6+DMs on the Sentencing table. For crimes involving smuggling banned goods, the DM is equal to the difference between the planet’s law level and the banned goods in question. Other crimes have a set DM:

  ------------------------- --------------
  Assault                   Law level -5
  Destruction of Property   Law level -3
  False Identity            Law level -2
  Manslaughter              Law level -1
  Murder                    Law level +0
  ------------------------- --------------

A character with the Advocate skill may attempt to reduce the severity of sentencing by making a check. If successful, reduce the Sentencing DM by the Effect of the check.

  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sentencing Roll   Sentence
  0 or less         Dismissed or trivial punishment
  1-2               Fine of 1d6 x 1,000 credits
  3-4               Fine of 2d6 x 5,000 credits
  5-6               Exile or a fine of 2d6 x 10,000 credits
  7-8               Imprisonment for 1d6 months or exile or fine of 2d6 x 20,000 credits
  9-10              Imprisonment for 1d6 years or exile
  11-12             Imprisonment for 2d6 years or exile
  13-14             Life imprisonment
  15+               Death
  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A result of Exile means that the character must leave the planet immediately and never return. Fines for smuggling goods are per ton of goods seized - gun running can be an extremely risky proposition.

### Starport

To determine the level of a starport on a planet, roll 2d6:

#### Starport Table

  ----------- ----------------
  Roll        Starport Class
  2 or less   X
  3-4         E
  5-6         D
  7-8         C
  9-10        B
  11+         A
  ----------- ----------------

### Technology Level

The Technology Level of the planet is determined by rolling 1d6 and adding DMs as follows:

  ---------------- ---- -- ------------ ---- -- ------------------ ----
  Starport Value   DM      Size Value   DM      Atmosphere Value   DM
  0                        0            +2      0                  +1
  1                        1            +2      1                  +1
  2                        2            +1      2                  +1
  3                        3            +1      3                  +1
  4                        4            +1      4

### Bases

Naval
: A naval base is a supply depot, refuelling station, repair yard or fortress of the Navy. Naval vessels can obtain refined fuel and supplies here.

Scout
: A scout base offers refined fuel and supplies to scout ships.

Research
: A Research base is dedicated to a particular field of research.

Consulate
: A consulate is an administration office for various departments such as commerce, justice and foreign affairs. Characters wishing to report significant crimes or obtain various permits will need to visit a consulate.

Pirate
: The presence of a pirate base in a system indicates that a group of thieves is active in the area. Pirates are unlikely to be operating out of the starport itself (except on a Law Level 0 world), but no doubt have agents at the port on the look-out for likely prey.

### Travel Codes

There are two travel codes – Amber and Red. An Amber world has been deemed dangerous, and travellers are warned to be on their guard. Amber worlds are often undergoing upheaval or revolution, or else are naturally hazardous environments.

Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is forbidden. A world might be Red because the world is too dangerous to allow visitors. Interdictions are enforced by the Navy.

A world with an Atmosphere of 10+, a government of 0, 7 or 10, or a Law Level of 0 or 9+ should be considered for Amber status. Red codes are given out at the discretion of the Referee.
