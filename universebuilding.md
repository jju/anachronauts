# Space Travel

There are different forms of æther travel, all of which get around the lightspeed barrier. This makes them all weird, and fantastical. One of the great differences of the CoreWorlds and their renaissance has been the diffusion of philosophical, magical, outside of physical world knowledge. This is a universe of metaphysics and one that has been created and maintained with that in mind. This is not because of any one creator - there are no gods who made things one way and not another - there are only the actions of individuals which coalesce into creating the universe as it is.

## History

At some point a Terasecond or so ago humanity had a pretty good handle on how to transform fundamental building blocks of matter into useful forms. The unbreakable lightspeed barrier and the time it would take and the radiation and just general fuckery of dealing with interstellar relativistic travel meant that sending fleshy sacks of carbon to other stars for the possibility of setting human flesh on a new frontier made that a non-starter (of course there were wackos, willing to load up colony ships filled with meatbags in freezers to give it a shot).

### Seedphase

What made more sense to the people of that time (many of whom were spending more time in virtual spaces anyway) was to transmit information on how to reassemble a certain level of technology and biology and just put it out there. It would be slow in comparison to hopping onto a plane and getting somewhere, but the information would be out there.

Now, the technology wasn't at the point where you could transmit a code at an asteroid and it would spontaneously turn into a human factory, so they sent very small satellites, little seeds at sublight speeds and they sent them everywhere. These seeds would be able to take the information they were broadcasting and reassemble something approximating life in the places it got to.

The seeds were small and ran programs with whole virtual societies running on them. Each one debated as they approached stars about how to deploy their resources and most decided to set up in systems. They had plans for how to create entities and societies and they were able to harvest information being sent along more quickly from home. Decisions were made and vast chunks of the galaxy was seeded.

Because of the lightspeed barrier there was little travel between these seeded systems. Not only would it take ages to get between them (which wasn't necessarily a terrible thing if most of your entities were non biological) but most entities were happy to do their own experiments in the places they were. There was a bit of room to see how constant expansion might not make any of the issues individuals faced any more surmountable. Communities were scattered among the stars, talking to each other with comfortable delays. Quantum entanglement communicators were often exchanged, more as an interesting project than for any need to communicate faster. If there were major catastrophes in the works they were broken out, but mostly it was an emergency beacon.

### The cult of flesh

The cult of flesh grew up through communication between a number of worlds that had relatively carbon-friendly environments and who had put their factories to work creating biological beings, usually in the shape of the humanoid ancestors. This newly re-biologized version of humanity was very interested in many things, but possibly the most momentous was the notion of contact with other biologies.

Through communion with other quasi-biological entities that inhabited dimensions unknown to the seed civilization, the higher dimensions were opened up breaking a whole host of technological barriers. One of these dimensions was ætherspace.

Through the æther, faster than light travel was now possible. The cult of flesh retook the ancient name of humanity and set out to conquer the stars.

### beacons in the night

Humanity now had many shapes and forms that it was using to travel among the stars. They learned quite quickly about the dangers inherent in the higher dimensions and worked diligently to make them work for them rather than against. One of the early keys was to use the quantum entanglement communicators that were part of the seedphase as the signposts for navigation. 

The Æther was a strange place; it didn't behave like normal space where the things that would kill you were hard radiation and cosmic rays. You also had large issues in communicating with normal space and definitely couldn't see anything that was happening in it when you were in the æther. Except for the QE beacons.

These became the guideposts for the new onslaught of humanity. Most of them were the sites of moderately happy communities, but since they were what was visible to the fleshy beings travelling at such incredible speed they were immediately overwhelmed. The biologicals were happy to destroy or repurpose the factories in systems, ready to use the machines to build fleshy beings primed and ready to inhabit the systems. In many cases the Seedphase inhabitants were left alone as the systems they inhabited weren't directly useful to the biologicals. Some of the Seedcivs began re-editing their depictions of their situations so as not to attract humanity's attention.

In this time, as in many, it was slightly unclear what anyone wanted. Humanity was pouring out to the stars often at random, sometimes in the company of terrifying creatures they'd met in the æther. Many of those creatures had specific desires for resources found only circling certain types of stars, and they were usually not as adept at manipulating matter as the reassmbling machines of the seedcivs were. Humanity was working hard at biological manipulation and left deep physics mostly alone. There was so much power to be had in the new alien powers of the mind. 

### rise of the coreworlds

People wanted places to live and let live without the notion of FTL biological cousins bursting into a star system and raining rocks on your world. As the expansion and genocide began to cool down a sober second thought kind of organization began to arise. It took a long time but eventually, using the quantum entanglement communicators something approaching an interstellar civilization was established. It was mostly a loose federation, and left the most rapacious servitude of the higherdimensional beasts behind it.

The core worlds maturity truly began with the ætheric tunnel near the end of the 11th Terasecond. Now people could go through the void at FTL speeds without needing to rely on Ætheric navigators and pilots. FTL could be systematized, and it connected systems. The expansion of this network continues today into Sector EDG.

## STL Travel

Slower than light travel (STL) remains the primary means of transportation within a star system (and beyond for some). This is not just because most people do not travel between stars, though that is important. Seedphase humans tend to be in places they want to be. Meatsack humans, despite their rapacious nature when they do travel the stars are still more suited to planetary environments. It is actually a weird thing to travel the stars, and is seen as bizarrely tainted by the many entities residing in the universe.

Within a system there are all sorts of politics and scientific frontiers to deal with. While yes, many of them will be similar to ones happening in different parts of the galaxy that doesn't make them less meaningful to the people dealing with them.

There is also a political message to be made by eschewing FTL in any form. Because it has been used as a tool of colonization and oppression, there are many, especially those who are or sympathize with Seedphase humanity, who refuse to use it. There are also religious reasons not to traverse the æther, as it does seem to require trafficking with powers that are fundamentally opposed to rational thinking.

## Æ-Drive

The Æther-drive is a bit of a misnomer. Entering ætheric space doesn't require a drive per se. It is about hooking into the flows and currents that exist in this other world. It doesn't require precise calculations as much as perception of hidden currents. In much the same way a kite-flyer looks at airflows differently than a millipede.

There are a number of versions of Æ-drives. 

* There are biological inhabitants of the universe that also traverse ætherspace. It can be possible to hitch a ride with one of them, providing you can persuade one to take you and can maintain life support (nonbiologicals tend not to do this, but there's nothing preventing it).
* The most common and oldest are Æ-Hooks, which catch into the appropriate current. This requires a biological on board to perceive (and many seedphase would add "believe in") the currents. These hooks don't require any special fuel expenditure and limit the type of manoeuvring that's possible in ætherspace.
* Æ-Drives have been developed to simply enter ætherspace and exist there navigating it on the fly, the way one would in physics-space (just faster). There is a greater fuel expense to power one's way through the æther and it can be frustratingly exotic if one doesn't have allies native to the æther. One doesn't *need* a biological navigator and can bruteforce your way through ætherspace in this manner, but most non-psi-adept beings tend to break like eggs when they do this. For resource-rich seedphase humanity this can be the preferred method of FTL transporting ideas. As of 1105 this is still somewhat risqué for most seedphase.
* The Æ-Tunnel is a newer CoreWorlds technology. It systematizes transport between two quantum beacons. This no longer requires a biological navigator on board, but limits the embarkation and disembarkation points to quantum beacons. The CoreWorlds monopolize & heavily defend those points in systems where they have established tunnels and regularly escort vessels in ætherspace. Combining Æ-Drives and Æ-Tunnels is possible, though it tends to damage the tunnelling effect. Another reason for the patrolling by the TransportPowers.

## TransportPowers

The TransportPowers are the forces within the CoreWorlds that have been charged with maintaining the travel between stars. They have invested a galactically huge amount of resources into creating the Æ-tunnelling network (and currently into extending the ranges, so fewer jumps are needed). This bureaucratization of the fact that meatsack humanity is a cult in thrall to higher-dimensional beings that, quite frankly, couldn't give a shit about us going from star to star.

Ostensibly, the purpose of the TransportPowers is to secure trade amongst the stars. This holds up in the CoreWorlds because the TransportPowers aren't the kind of institution that most meatsack humans care about. There are of course propaganda tales of The Fleet's famous ships like the TPS Herculean, but those are buried in the rest of life for planetary-bound meatsacks. The idea of trading amongst the stars for resources (that could be produced practically anywhere with very old Terasecond-scale and traditional technologies) is absurd in any but a religious framework.

Seedphase humanity is very very very aware of the Transport Powers. As far as the general Seed consensus goes, the TransportPowers is a prettied up version of the silicon-thirsty imperialists that destroyed so many seeds a few Gigaseconds ago. Yes there were backups but that basically means the completely foreign means the CoreWorlds used have been experienced by the seeds. Seeds are very very wary of the expansion being driven by the Quantum Tunnelling effect. Because they generally eschew FTL communication for anything beyond the most dire situations (and the mere destruction of a seed isn't usually that dire, because of the backups clause) there isn't a huge amount of care for what is going on so far away.

The TransportPowers maintain a database of systems based on seedphase reports and meatsack reconnaisance (sometimes performed in force). After the rise of the cult of flesh a number of seedcivs beyond the TP's immediate purview began falsifying data, so the UPPs residing in the CoreWorlds systems can be contradictory. Selah.

The TransportPowers are dedicated to projecting an image of their Fleet's role being one of calm protection and scientific exploration. News of newly discovered life forms are always widely distributed and there is much less (though one can't say entirely none) rampant terraforming of worlds where life could thrive. The age of flesh was, frankly a disgusting time for this (and is responsible for the habitability of the majority of the CoreWorlds).

Dealing with aliens is on the galactic scale not part of the TPs remit. A Department of Ætherial Affairs is traditional in CoreWorlds-aligned polities. The DÆA had more influence in the Æ-Hooks-dominated times and are looking to regain that power now that the TPs are moving towards a more materialist approach in dealing with ætherspace. This plays into the hands of the Seedcivs, they say giving untold power to mere machines. It gets weird.

## game mechanics

Space travel in anachronauts primarily uses the rules found in the SRD. This section will be detailing the exceptions.

Most notably, there is no "Grav" technology in this universe. Generating gravity is done mostly by spin or thrust. Consequently spaceships, ætherships are not designed along star-trek kinds of lines. Shuttles are more important for interacting with stmospheres. Space elevators/beanstalks are more common than in the traditional Traveller universe.

### Æ-hooks

Æther-hooks take up tonnage and cost in a craft equal to an SRD J-Drive. If you are retrofitting statistics form Traveller ships simply convert the fuel requirements to the power plant, which functions in the same manner.

One of the important things about ætherhooks is that they 

Astrogation and having an accomplished Astrogator on board is very important when using æ-hooks.

1. Plot course. Roll Astrogation (-4,-hexdistanceDM[^1: Æ-Hooks can only travel the hex distance of their rating safely],ksec) 
   On success, the Effect replaces 1 of the d6 in the TravelTime roll. 
   On failure, a reroll is possible (-2DM) but the Effect of this failed roll is added to the d6 in the TravelTime roll.
2. Enter ætherspace. Roll Physics(ætherspace) or Pilot (+2 if Astrogator on board/-6 if not,-8 if in Low Orbit or closer of a massive body,dasec)
   On success, the ship is in ætherspace.
   On failure, reroll is possible (-2DM cumulative)[^2: you can turn it off and turn it on again to reset the reroll penalties with a +4 Engineer (hasec) roll].
3. Determine duration of voyage in 10ksec. TravelTime roll: 2d6 +1d6/hex travelled.
   Using a higher-powered æ-drive than necessary for the hexes one is travelling reduces the TravelTime by 10ksec per point of excess.[^3: So a æ-3 hook ship travelling 1 hex away would have a TravelTime of 3d6-2 ksec.]
4. Exit æ-space. Roll Pilot (+2 if Astrogator aboard/-6 if not,sec).
   On success, the ship is now safely in p-space within medium range of the beacon and at least short range from any other vessel/obstacle. If this is impossible to achieve, see failure.
   On failure, reroll is possible (-2DM)[^4: No Engineer reset roll allowed.]. If failure continues a new Astrogation roll is required see rerolls in step 1.

Being stuck in æ-space is no good.

### Æ-drives

Æther-drives take up tonnage in a craft equal to an SRD J-Drive. They also have exotic fuel costs, so unlike æ-hooks they use the fuel compartment allocations. The cost of an æ-drive is much higher than the equivalent æhooks.

Astrogation and having an accomplished Astrogator on board is less important when using an æ-drives.

1. Plot course. Roll Astrogation (-4,-hexdistanceDM[^1: Æ-Drives can only travel the hex distance of their rating safely],ksec) 
   On success, the Effect replaces 1 of the d6 in the TravelTime roll. 
   On failure, a reroll is possible (-2DM) but the Effect of this failed roll is added to the d6 in the TravelTime roll.
2. Enter ætherspace. Roll Engineer(Æ-Drive) or Pilot (+0,-8 if in Low Orbit or closer of a massive body,dasec)
   On success, the ship is in ætherspace.
   On failure, reroll is possible (-2DM)[^2: you can turn it off and turn it on again to reset the reroll penalties with a +4 Engineer (hasec) roll].
3. Determine duration of voyage in 10ksec. TravelTime roll: 2d6 +1d6/hex travelled.
   Using a higher-powered æ-drive than necessary for the hexes one is travelling reduces the TravelTime by 1d6 rolled per point of excess.[^3: So a æ-3 hook ship travelling 1 hex away would have a 1d6 ksec TravelTime.]
4. Exit æ-space. Roll Pilot (+0,sec).
   On success, the ship is now safely in p-space within medium range of the beacon and at least short range from any other vessel/obstacle. If this is impossible to achieve, see failure.
   On failure, reroll is possible (-2DM)[^4: No Engineer reset roll allowed.]. If failure continues a new Astrogation roll is required see rerolls in step 1.

## Quantum Tunnels

Quantum Tunnels

1. Plot course. This is done by the Tunnellers and the Effect is always 5. This Effect 5 replaces the highest die in the TravelTime roll.
2. Enter ætherspace. Roll Pilot (+4,dasec)
   On success, the ship is in ætherspace.
   On failure, reroll is possible (-2DM)[^2: you can turn it off and turn it on again to reset the reroll penalties with a +4 Engineer (hsec) roll].
3. Determine duration of voyage in 10ksec. TravelTime roll: 2d6 +1d6/hex travelled.
   Replace the highest die with a 5 (from step 1)
4. Exit æ-space. Roll Pilot (+4,sec).
   On success, the ship is now safely in p-space within short range of the beacon and at least short range from any other vessel/obstacle. If this is impossible to achieve, see failure.
   On failure, reroll is possible (-2DM cumulative)[^4: No Engineer reset roll allowed.]. If this gets impossible, roll Astrogation (+2 if Astrogator on board/-6 if not,ksec). The Effect of this roll is added to the TravelTime roll, after which there's another chance for a roll to exit ætherspace.
