# Space Travel

There are different forms of aether travel, all of which get around the lightspeed barrier. This makes them all weird, and fantastical. One of the great differences of the CoreWorlds and their renaissance has been the diffusion of philosophical, magical, outside of physical world knowledge. This is a universe of metaphysics and one that has been created and maintained with that in mind. This is not because of any one creator - there are no gods who made things one way and not another - there are only the actions of individuals which coalesce into creating the universe as it is.

## History

At some point thousands of years ago humanity had a pretty good handle on how to transform fundamental building blocks of matter into useful forms. The unbreakable lightspeed barrier and the time it would take and the radiation and just general fuckery of dealing with interstellar relativistic travel meant that sending fleshy sacks of carbon to other stars for the possibility of setting human flesh on a new frontier made that a non-starter (of course there were wackos, willing to load up colony ships filled with meatbags in freezers to give it a shot).

### Seedphase

What made more sense to the people of that time (many of whom were spending more time in virtual spaces anyway) was to transmit information on how to reassemble a certain level of technology and biology and just put it out there. It would be slow in comparison to hopping onto a plane and getting somewhere, but the information would be out there.

Now, the technology wasn't quite at the point where you could transmit a code at an asteroid and it would spontaneously turn into a human factory, so they sent very small satellites, little seeds at sublight speeds and they sent them everywhere. These seeds would be able to take the information they were broadcasting and reassemble something approximating life in the places it got to.

The seeds were small and ran programs with whole virtual societies running on them. Each one debated as they approached stars about how to deploy their resources and most decided to set up in systems. They had plans for how to create entities and societies and they were able to harvest information being sent along more quickly from home. Decisions were made and vast chunks of the galaxy was seeded.

Because of the lightspeed barrier there was little travel between these seeded systems. Not only would it take ages to get between them (which wasn't necessarily a terrible thing if most of your entities were non biological) but most entities were happy to do their own experiments in the places they were. There was a bit of room to see how constant expansion might not make any of the issues individuals faced any more surmountable. Communities were scattered among the stars, talking to each other with comfortable delays. Quantum entanglement communicators were often exchanged, more as an interesting project than for any need to communicate faster. If there were major catastrophes in the works they were broken out, but mostly it was an emergency beacon.

### The cult of flesh

The cult of flesh grew up through communication between a number of worlds that had relatively carbon-friendly environments and who had put their factories to work creating biological beings, usually in the shape of the human ancestors. This newly re-biologized version of humanity was very interested in many things, but possibly the most momentous was the notion of other biologies.

Through communion with other biological entities that inhabited dimensions unknown to the seed civilization, the higher dimensions were opened up breaking a whole host of technological barriers. One of these dimensions was aetherspace.

Through the aether, faster than light travel was now possible. The cult of flesh retook the ancient name of humanity and set out to conquer the stars.
