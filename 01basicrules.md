Die Roll Conventions
====================

Check (or Throw)
: To determine if a character succeeds or fails at a particular task, the player must make a check. To make a check, the player rolls 2d6 and adds any appropriate Dice Modifiers (such as a skill her character possesses, or a bonus from a piece of equipment). If the total is equal to or greater than the target number for that check, she succeeds. A check will usually have a skill or characteristic associated with it. For example, a check of ‘Dex 8+’ means ‘roll 2d6, add your Dexterity Characteristic Modifier, and you succeed if you have a total result of 8 or more’.

Target Numbers
: In many checks, the player needs to roll equal to or above a specific number (usually, eight or more). This is denoted by a number followed by a plus, such as 8+.
: In Anachronauts the Target Number is always 8+ and difficulties are expressed as DMs.

Dice Modifier (DM)
: A number to be applied to a die roll before it is used. Dice Modifiers are preceded by a sign, which indicates if the number is to be added to or subtracted from the roll. For example, a Dice Modifier of -2 indicates that two is to be subtracted from the roll; a Die Modifier of +4 indicates that four is to be added to the roll.

[^1]: See the Skills & Tasks section for more on DMs.

Difficulty     | DM |
:--------------|:--:|
Simple         | +6 |
Easy           | +4 |
Routine        | +2 |
Challenging    | +0 |
Difficult      | -2 |
Very Difficult | -4 |
Formidable     | -6 |

> Unless otherwise noted a modified roll of 8+ is a *costly* success, and a modified roll of 12+ is a *flawless* success.
>
> On a costly success use the highest die for the Timing and the lowest die for the Effect.
>
> On a flawless success use the highest die for the Effect and the lowest die for the Timing.

Technology Levels
=================

Technology Levels measure the scientific-industrial capacity of a world and the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment.

TL 0
: Nothing obviously created but clever uses of the natural environment are common.

TL 1
: Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology. Writing is developed.

TL 2
: Warring States technology. Block printing.

TL 3
: (Nonindustrial) The advances of TL 2 are now applied, bringing the germ of industrial revolution and steam power. Wood and metal are still the main construction materials. Moveable Type. Debt.

TL 4
: (Industrial) Construction can now involve plastics, radio and industrial revolution inventions.

TL 5
: (Industrial) Widespread electrification, tele-communications and internal combustion if in a fossil-fuel rich environment.

TL 6
: (Industrial) TL 6 brings the development of fission power and microchip computing.

TL 7
: (Modern) A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and has telecommunications satellites.

TL 8
: (Late Modern) At TL 8, it is possible to reach other worlds in the same system, although terraforming or full colonisation are not within the culture’s capacity. Computers, lasers, miniaturization and mature nuclear fission technology all exists.

TL 9
: (Information) The defining element of TL 9 is the development of vast information networks on a planetary scale. Aetherhooks can be created with the proper materials and supplications (though historically they were not).

TL 10
: (Microscience) With the advent of cryogenics and mechanical/cyborg assists, lifespans are extended virtually and nearby systems are opened up. AI is an actual thing, fusion technology is coming into being as are more useful robots.

TL 11
: (Transhuman) The first sapient artificial intelligences become possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. Fusion technology is maturing, antimatter is being theoretically understood.

TL 12
: (Geoengineering) Weather control revolutionises terraforming and agriculture.

TL 13
: (Seedphase) Matter transmogrification nanotechnology is mature and allows for massive rewriting of physical reality.

TL 14
: (Cult of Flesh) Fusion weapons and vast destructive arrays available. (Historically "humanity" was at this TL when the discovery of ætherspace went mainstream.)

TL 15
: (High Stellar) Aetherdrives developed, bringing FTL to those who don't want to make pacts with dark powers.
