Equipment
=========

Each item is listed with the Technology Level needed to manufacture it, its mass (in kg) and its cost. If an item’s mass or cost is not listed, then its mass or cost is negligible.

Credits
-------

The Credit (Cr.) is the standard unit of currency in Traveller. Larger denominations include the KiloCredit (KCr; 1,000 Credits) and the MegaCredit (MCr; 1,000,000 Credits).

Armour
------

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armour can be worn at a time. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer layer of armour is next applied to the inner layer.

Some armours have a required skill. A character suffers a -2 DM to all actions taken in the armour per missing skill level, including level 0.

Jack (TL 1)
: A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs.

Mesh (TL 6)
: A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.

Cloth (TL 7)
: A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can result in bruising. However, cloth armour is highly useful and versatile – it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice something unusual.

Flak Jacket (TL 7)
: A less expensive version of ballistic cloth, the bulky flak jacket is an unmistakably military garment.

Vacc Suit (TL 8)
: The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer’s best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and radiation typically found in a hard vacuum, for six hours.

Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8)
: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere. HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to flames, intense radiation such as that found at nuclear blast sites, and high pressure environments like undersea trenches.

Ablat (TL 9)
: A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat armour is made from a material that ablates (vaporises) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat reduces its armour value (versus lasers) by one, but the armour is cheap and easily replaceable.

Reflec (TL 10)
: Reflec armour is a flexible plastic suit with layers of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armour.

Combat Armour (TL 11)
: This full-body suit is used by the military and not generally available on the open market, although those with military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty. It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armour protects from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit and provides life support for six hours.

Battle Dress (TL 13)
: The ultimate personal armour, battle dress is a powered form of combat armour. The servomotors vastly increase the user’s speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by +4 while wearing the armour. Damage to the wearer’s characteristics is calculated as normal, but the values from the armour are used for all other purposes such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The suit has a built-in computer/2 running an Expert Tactics (military)/2 program to give tactical advice and updates and is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full protection against environmental hazards - including NBC shielding - as if it was an HEV suit. TL 14 battle dress is considerably stronger, giving Strength +6 instead of +4, and upgrades its internal systems to Computer/3 (although still running Tactics 2).

### Options

Most of the options listed here can also be applied to normal clothing at the same cost. The exceptions are extended life support and grav assist.

Eye Protection (TL 6)
: Many armours include eye protection such as visors or goggles to guard against flying debris but such protection becomes absolutely vital at TL 9 to guard against the blinding effects of lasers. Eye protection can be added to any armour and is included for free in any TL 9+ armour. Cr 50.

Magnetic Grapples (TL 8)
: Magnetic plates in the boots of the armour allow the user to walk normally on a spacecraft without artificial gravity. Cr. 100.

Computer Weave (TL 10)
: Computer weave can be added to any armour that does not already have a computer system, and gives Computer/0 to that armour. Cr 500.

Extended Life Support (TL 10)
: This upgrade can be added to any suit that provides life support (vacc suit, HEV suit, combat armour, battle dress). By adding high-pressure oxygen tanks and recycling systems, the suit now provides eighteen hours of oxygen. Cr. 10,000.

Medikit (TL 10)
: An internal medical scanner and drug injector, the medikit can be installed in combat armour, battle dress or a vacc suit. It automatically applies first aid if the wearer is reduced to Endurance 0 (treat the Medikit as having Medic 3). It can also administer Fast Drug on command, or if life support systems are failing (turning remaining minutes of life support into hours). Cr 5,000. A TL 11 medikit can also inject Combat or Slow drugs and the Slow Drug antidote on command. Cr 10,000.

Smart Fabric (TL 10)
: Smart fabric resists stains and dirt, cleaning itself automatically. Cr. 1,000.

IR Chameleon (TL 12)
: IR (infra-red) chameleon technology can be added to any full-body suit of clothing or armour. It selectively bleeds heat to match background IR levels and effectively renders the wearer invisible to IR (Very Difficult (–4) to detect with sensors). IR Chameleon costs Cr. 5,000.

Grav Assist (TL 12)
: This upgrade can be added to combat armour or battle dress only, and adds the functionality of a grav belt to the armour at the cost of Cr. 110,000. The TL 15 version lasts longer. Costs Cr 120,000.

Vislight Chameleon (TL 13)
: A more advanced form of IR Chameleon, Vislight Chameleon covers the surface of the armour with light-bending technology, making the wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye (+4 DM to Stealth rolls). Vislight Chameleon costs Cr. 50,000.

Augments
--------

Augmentation can bring characteristics above the normal maximum for a race.

Augments can interfere with medical treatment. All long-term care or surgery Medic rolls treating an augmented character suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Technology Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant. For example, a character with TL 15 Endurance implants being treated in a TL 10 hospital would give a -5 DM to the surgeon’s Medic skill checks.

Neural Comm (TL 10)
: A neural comm has identical capacities to a standard comm, but the cost is much higher and the TL is increased by 2. For example, an audio-only comm costs 250 Credits and is TL 10. A character can access the capabilities of a neural comm by thought alone but must still make any relevant skill checks and must still speak aloud to send audio messages.

  ------- ------------------------------------ ------------
  TL 10   Audio only                           Cr. 1,000
  TL 12   Audio and visual, Computer/0         Cr. 5,000
  TL 14   Multiple forms of data, Computer/1   Cr. 20,000
  ------- ------------------------------------ ------------

Subdermal Armour (TL 10)
: Adds a mesh of ballistic fibres to the skin and reinforces the bones, giving the character extra armour. Subdermal armour stacks with other protection.

  ------- ---------- -------------
  TL 10   Armour 1   Cr. 50,000
  TL 11   Armour 3   Cr. 100,000
  ------- ---------- -------------

Physical Characteristic Augmentation (TL 11)
: A character’s Endurance, Strength or Dexterity can be increased in various ways, from replacing
motor neurons with faster synthetic cells, to reinforcing bones and replacing organs with tougher vat-grown clones. Augmentations must be purchased for each characteristic separately.

  ------- ------------------- ---------------
  TL 11   Characteristic +1   Cr. 500,000
  TL 12   Characteristic +2   Cr. 1,000,000
  TL 15   Characteristic +3   Cr. 5,000,000
  ------- ------------------- ---------------

Augmentation (TL 12)
: Replacing slow nerve cells with faster synthetic substrates and implanting optoelectronic boosters can increase the speed at which a character thinks, effectively boosting his Intelligence.

  ------- ----------------- ---------------
  TL 12   Intelligence +1   Cr. 500,000
  TL 14   Intelligence +2   Cr. 1,000,000
  TL 16   Intelligence +3   Cr. 5,000,000
  ------- ----------------- ---------------

Skill Augmentation (TL 12)
: The character’s nervous system is rewired to be more suited to a particular task. A pilot might have his reflexes and sense of balance improved; a broker might be made capable of controlling his pupil responses and smelling the pheromones and skin salinity of the other party. A skill augmentation gives the character a +1 DM when using that skill. Cr. 50,000. A character can only have one skill augmentation and must possess that skill at level 0 to benefit from the augmentation.

Wafer Jack (TL 12)
: A wafer jack is a computer system implanted into the base of the skull that consists of an external data socket and a processor running an interface program. A character with a wafer jack can use expert programs for tasks relying on Intelligence or Education only. The main benefit of the jack is that it is much smaller and more discrete than a hand computer, and the user can access the expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack is a Computer/2 (Computer/4 at TL 13) and can only run expert programs. It is always running Intelligent Interface at no cost. Cr. 10,000. (Cr. 15,000 at TL 13.)

Enhanced Vision (TL 13)
: A character can be implanted with cybernetic eyes giving him the abilities of a set of binoculars and IR/ Light Intensifier goggles at the cost of Cr. 25,000.

Communications
--------------

Bug (TL 5)
: Surveillance devices such as hidden microphones and tiny cameras, bugs are available from TL 5 onwards. They rapidly miniaturise and become more intelligent. A TL 14 bug can be no bigger than a dust mote. The smaller a bug, though, the shorter its range - a bug that transmits data needs a much larger power supply than one that just records until it is collected.

  ------- -------------------------------------- ---------
  TL 5    Audio                                  Cr. 50
  TL 7    Audio or Visual                        Cr. 100
  TL 9    Audio or Visual or Data                Cr. 200
  TL 11   Audio/Visual/Data                      Cr. 300
  TL 13   Audio/Visual/Data/Bioscan              Cr. 400
  TL 15   Audio/Visual/Data/Bioscan/Computer/1   Cr. 500
  ------- -------------------------------------- ---------

* Audio: The bug records anything it hears.
* Visual: The bug records anything it sees.
* Data: If attached to a computer system, the bug can search and copy data from the computer. The bug cannot breach computer security on its own, but if a user accesses the computer in the bug’s  presence, the bug can read his data.
* Bioscan: The bug has a basic biological scanner, allowing it to sample the area for DNA traces, chemical taint and so forth.
* Computer/1: The bug has an onboard computer system with Computer/1

A bug can be active or passive. An active bug transmits data (either constantly, or when triggered). Passive bugs just record until activated.

Transceiver (TL 5)
: A transceiver is a stand-alone communications device. Unlike a comm, which relies on the presence of an established communications network, a transceiver can send and receive directly under its own power.

To reach orbit reliably, a transceiver needs a range of 500 kilometres.

  -------------------- ----------- ------------------------ ------------
  Radio Transceivers   Mass (kg)   Range                    Cost (Cr.)

  TL 5                 20          Distant (5 km)           50

  TL 13 (Computer/1)   -           Regional (500 km)        500
  -------------------- ----------- ------------------------ ------------

Comm (TL 6)
: A personal comm unit is a portable telecommunications device/computer/camera, ranging in size from a bulky handset to a slim watch or pen-like cylinder. Larger comms have physical controls and screens, while smaller units either project data and control displays onto nearby surfaces, have fold-out plastic screens, or connect to cybernetics. Comms have only short-range transmission and reception capabilities, but most technologically advanced worlds will have planet-wide comm networks allowing the user to send messages and access data anywhere.

  ------- ------------------------------------ ---------
  TL 6    Audio only                           Cr. 50
  TL 8    Audio and visual, computer/0         Cr. 150
  TL 10   Multiple forms of data, computer/1   Cr. 500
  ------- ------------------------------------ ---------

Commdot (TL 10)
: A commdot is a tiny microphone/speaker and transmitter, ranging in size between a few centimetres and a few millimetres across. A commdot is capable of interfacing with another communications device and relaying messages back and forth. Commdots have a range of only a few metres. They are usually used as hands-free communicators, but can also be used as improvised bugs or throat microphones. Cr. 10 each.

Holographic Projector (TL 11)
: A holographic projector is a toaster-sized box that, when activated, creates a three-dimensional image in the space around it or nearby – the range is approximately three metres in all directions. The image can be given pre-programmed animations within a limited range and the projector includes speakers for making sound. The projected holograms are obviously not real so this device is mostly used for communication. The TL 12 version can produce holograms real enough to fool anyone who fails an Intelligence check (made upon first seeing the hologram) and the TL 13 version can produce holograms that are true-to-life images.

  ------- ------------
  TL 11   Cr. 1,000
  TL 12   Cr. 2,000
  TL 13   Cr. 10,000
  ------- ------------

Computers
---------

The power of a computer is given by its rating (Computer/1, Computer/2 and so forth), which measures the complexity of the programs it can run. (Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.) Programs are rated by the computer rating they require. A system can run a number of programs up to its rating .

The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above. Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing power for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-game. Desktops become obsolete during TL 8.

  ------------ ---------------- ----------- ------------
  Optimum TL   Computer Power   Mass (kg)   Cost (Cr.)
  TL 7         Computer/0       10          50
  TL 8         Computer/1       5           100
  TL 9         Computer/1       5           250
  TL 10        Computer/2       1           350
  TL 11        Computer/2       1           500
  TL 12        Computer/3       0.5         1,000
  TL 13        Computer/4       0.5         1,500
  TL 14        Computer/5       0.5         5,000
  ------------ ---------------- ----------- ------------

Computer Terminal (TL 7)
: This is a ‘dumb terminal’, with only limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful computer such as a ship’s computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size depending on their control method – a holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and screen. A computer terminal has Computer/0, and costs Cr. 200.

Hand Computer (TL 7)
: A hand computer is a portable computer system with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than a computer terminal, and can be used without access to a network. A hand computer costs twice as much as a normal computer of the same TL but can he held in one hand and operated with the other.

### Options

Data Display/Recorder (TL 13)
: This headpiece worn over one or both eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing him to view computer data from any linked system. Because of the transparent screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R headset. DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers - they can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results and so forth. Cr. 5,000.

Data Wafer (TL 10)
: The principle medium of information storage is the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit card. A TL 10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of data storage. Cr 5.

Computer
: A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only. The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Computer/1, but it could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is specially designed for that task. A specialised computer costs 25% more per added rating. In addition, running the program a computer is specialised for does not use up rating when working out how many programs the computer can run simultaneously.

Software
--------

A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to a minimum of the lowest rating shown.

Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

Medical Supplies
----------------

Cryoberth (TL 10)
: A cryoberth, or ‘icebox’, is a coffin-like machine similar to the low or frozen berths used on some spacecraft. A cryoberth can be used to place a severely injured character into stasis until he receives medical treatment. While in a cryoberth, a character’s wounds neither heal nor degrade and all disease and poison activity is halted. A cryoberth’s internal power system can function for up to one week on its own, but a berth is usually connected to a vehicle’s power supply. Wt. 200 kg, Cr. 50,000.

Medikit (TL 8+)
: There are different types of medikit available at different Technology Levels. All medikits contain diagnostic devices and scanners, surgical tools and a panoply of drugs and antibiotics, allowing a medic to practise his art in the field. Higher-technology medikits do not give a bonus to basic treatment, but can help with more exotic problems or when treating augmented individuals. For example, a TL 8 medikit can test blood pressure and temperature (among other things); a TL 14 kit has a medical densitometer to create a three-dimensional view of the patient’s body and can scan brain activity on the quantum level. All medikits weigh 8 kg.

* TL 8: Cr, 1,000.
* TL 10: Cr. 1,500.
* TL 12: Cr. 5,000.
* TL 14: Cr. 10,000.

### Drugs

Medicinal Drugs (TL 5+)
: include vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from five credits to several thousand credits, depending on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs require the Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than doing nothing. With a successful Medic check the correct drug can counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the very least give a positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult (-2 DM) poison with a damage of 1d6.

Panaceas (TL 8+)
: are wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are specifically designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A character using panaceas may make a Medic check as if he had Medic 0 when treating an infection or disease. Panaceas cost 200 credits per dose.

Anti-rad drugs (TL 8)
: must be administered before or immediately after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per dose. A character may only use anti-rad drugs once per day - taking any more causes permanent Endurance damage of 1d6 per dose. Cr. 1,000 per dose.

Stim drugs (TL 8)
: remove fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses stim may remove the effects of fatigue but suffers one point of damage. If stims are used to remove fatigue again without an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of damage the second time, three points the third time, and so on. Stims cost 50 credits per dose.

Metabolic accelerator (‘Slow Drug’, TL 10)
: boosts the user’s reaction time to superhuman levels. A character using slow drug in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in  5 seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user’s system crashes. He suffers 2d6 points of damage and is exhausted. Metabolic accelerator costs 500 credits per dose.

Combat Drug (TL 10)
: This drug increases reaction time and improves the body’s ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge once each round with no effect on his initiative score and reduces all damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued. Combat drugs cost 1,000 credits per dose.

Medicinal Slow (TL 11)
: is a variant of the slow drug. It can only be applied safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo technology is available as it increases the metabolism to around thirty times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day. Medicinal slow costs 500 credits per dose.

Fast Drug (TL 10) or ‘Hibernation’
: puts the user into a state akin to suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to a ratio of 60 to 1 - a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth. Fast drug costs 200 credits per dose.

Anagathics (TL 15)
: slow the user’s aging process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all Technology Levels. Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. They cost 2,000 Credits per dose. One dose must be taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect - if the character taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate roll on the aging table as their body reacts badly to the interrupted supply.

### Medical Care

Healing
: An injured character who needs hospital care for a prolonged period will pay approximately 100 credits per month per Technology Level. (At TL 11+ the doctors will just use medicinal slow in most cases and charge for that instead.) Surgery costs 1d6 x 50 x Technology Level in Credits.

Replacements
: A character whose injuries require cloning limbs or cybernetic replacement must pay 5,000 credits per Characteristic point.

Robots and Drones
-----------------

A robot has an Intellect program running, allowing it to make decisions independently, while drones are remote-controlled by a character with the Remote Operations skill.

Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage as if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM of 0. Any robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence and Education score. Drones have neither. A robot’s Education characteristic is representative of the information programmed into it and even low-end robots can have high Education scores. Most robots have Social Standing characteristics of 0 as they are not social creations but there are some exceptions, usually high-end models running advanced Intellect programs. Drones do not have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to engage in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use his own Social Standing score.

Cargo Robot (TL 11)
: These simple, heavy-duty robots are found in starport docks and on board cargo ships. Cargo drones can be constructed as low as Technology Level 9 but their utility is extremely limited until the invention of Intellect programs.

>
> Price: 40,000 Credits

Combat Drone (TL 12)
: Combat drones are little more than flying guns mated to a grav floater and a computer system. The drones must be piloted with the Remote Operations skill but attacks are made using the appropriate weapon skill. Combat drones loaded with Intellect and combat Expert programs (making them autonomous combat robots) are illegal on many worlds.

> Strength 12 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+1), Hull 4, Structure 4
>
> Traits: Armour 9, Integral System (grav floater), Integral Weapon (any)

> Price: 120,000 Credits

### Options

Armour
: Armour can be increased by 5, which increases the drone or robot’s cost by 25%.

Integral System
: Certain devices can be built into drones or robots by increasing the cost of the device by +50%. Popular choices include toolkits of different kinds, various sensors, or mobility upgrades like thruster packs or grav floaters.

Integral Weapon
: Any suitable weapon can be added to a drone or robot, at the cost of Cr. 10,000 + the cost of the weapon.

At TL 11 sensors become notably more discriminating because they can be hooked up to a system running Intellect/1 that can dynamically filter information based on pre-set parameters – not sounding the alarm if the motion sensor picks up anything too small to be an intruder, for example.

Sensor equipment does not offer a bonus to skill checks but allows the user to find things that they would otherwise not be able to.

Binoculars (TL 3)
: Allows the user to see further. 1 kg, Cr. 75. At TL 8 electronic enhancement allows images to be captured; light-intensification allows them to be used in the dark. Cr 750. At TL 12 PRIS (Portable Radiation Imaging System) allows the user to observe a large section of the EM-spectrum, from infrared to gamma rays. Cr 3,500.

Geiger Counter (TL 5)
: Detects radiation, both presence and approximate intensity. Cr. 250. The Sensors skill is not needed to detect the presence of radiation with a Geiger counter but anything more complex than that requires a check.

IR Goggles (TL 6)
: Permits the user to see exothermic (heat-emitting) sources in the dark. Cr. 500.

Light-Intensifying Goggles (TL 7)
: Permits the user to see normally in anything less than total darkness by electronically intensifying any available light. Cr. 500.
: At TL 9, IR goggles and light-intensifying goggles can be combined into a single unit costing Cr. 1,250.

Motion Sensor (TL 7)
: A motion sensor simply detects any and all movement within the area assigned to it. It cannot differentiate between kinds of movement, it just reports whether there is movement or not in an area roughly six metres in diameter. Cr. 500. At TL 9 the motion detector can report the general qualities of motion – size, speed and duration – but no more. Cr. 1,000. The Sensors skill is not required to use a motion detector to detect motion. When trying to interpret data from a TL 9 motion sensor, the Sensors skill may need to be checked.

Electromagnetic Probe (TL 10)
: This handy device detects the electromagnetic emissions of technological devices, and can be used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment (+1 DM to work out what’s wrong with it) or when searching for hidden bugs or devices. Cr 1,000. The Sensors or Investigation skills can be used to sweep a room for bugs.

Densitometer (TL 14)
: The remote densitometer uses an object’s natural gravity to measure its density, building up a three-dimensional image of the inside and outside of an object. 5 kg. Cr. 20,000.

Bioscanner (TL 15)
: The bioscanner ‘sniffs’ for organic molecules and tests chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever it is focussed on. It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter, search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms. 3.5 kg. Cr. 350,000. The data from a bioscanner can be interpreted using the Sensors or the Life Sciences (biology) skills.

NAS (TL 15)
: This device consists of a backpack and detachable handheld unit, and can detect neural activity up to 500 metres away. The device can also give a rough estimation of the intelligence level of organisms based on brainwave patterns. 10 kg. Cr 35,000. The data from a neural activity scanner can be interpreted using the Sensors, the Life Sciences (biology) or the Social Sciences (sophontology) skills.

Survival Gear and Supplies
--------------------------

Tent (TL 3)
: A basic tent provides shelter for two people against the weather, reducing skill check penalties by 2. Cr. 200. The TL 7 tent can be pressurised. There is no airlock – the tent is depressurised when opened. Cr 2,000.

Rebreather (TL 6)
: The rebreather is a bulky backpack containing breathable atmosphere and a face mask that collects exhaled gasses and ‘scrubs’ them back into breathable gasses again. A rebreather provides six hours of breathable atmosphere and can be used to breathe in any environment that is not otherwise harmful, such as underwater. 10 kg, Cr. 250.

Respirator (TL 6)
: This device concentrates inhaled oxygen, allowing a character to breathe on worlds with a thin atmosphere. Respirators take the form of a face mask or mouthpiece initially. Cr. 100. The more advanced TL 10 respirator is small enough to fit into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 x cost. Cr. 2,000.

Filter (TL 7)
: Filters are breathing masks that strip out harmful elements from the air inhaled by the character, such as dangerous gases or dust particles. Cr 100. The TL 10 filter is small enough to fit into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 x cost. Cr. 2,000.

Breather Mask (TL 8)
: Combines the filter and respirator into a single package. Cr. 150.

Artificial Gill (TL 8)
: Extracts oxygen from water allowing the wearer to breathe underwater. Only works on worlds with breathable atmospheres (type 4–9). 4 kg. Cr 4,000.

Environment Suit (TL 8)
: Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat, the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed in normal operations. Costs Cr 500.

Habitat Module (TL 8)
: A modular, unpressurised quarters for six people, capable of withstanding anything less than hurricane-force winds. Includes survival rations and enough batteries to keep the lights on and the heaters (or air conditioning) running for a week. Requires 12 man-hours to assemble, and can be attached to other modules to form a base. Cr 10,000. The TL 10 module is pressurised, and includes life-support for six occupants for one week (1000 person/hours). Cr 20,000.

Rescue Bubble (TL 9)
: A large (2m diameter) pressurised plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user’s movements into electricity to recharge the bubble’s batteries and power its distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space and sea vessels as emergency lifeboats. Cr. 600.

Thruster Pack (TL 9)
: A simple thruster pack gives the user the ability to manoeuvre in zero-gravity. A Zero-G check is required to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in microgravity environments and are only practical for journeys between spacecraft at Adjacent range. Cr. 2,000.
: At TL 12 the long-range thruster pack gives 0.1g acceleration for up to 48 hours, using standard starship fuel. This increases its practical range on the spacecraft scale to Short but gives it a weight of 10 kg. Cr. 14,000. The TL 14 version of the long-range pack is much smaller as it uses grav-thruster plates instead, but has the same performance profile as the TL 12 version. Cr. 20,000.

Portable Generator (TL 10)
: This is a heavy-duty portable fusion generator, capable of recharging weapons and other equipment for up to one month of use. Cr. 500,000.

### Options

Self-Assembling (TL 11)
: The self-assembling upgrade can be given to tents, habitat modules and other basic structures. The structure is capable of expanding and assembling itself with only minimal aid, reducing the time needed to set up the shelter to a single man-hour. Cr. 5,000.

Self-Sealing (TL 13)
: Structures can be made self-repairing and self-sealing at TL 13 for Cr. 2,000. Small breaches and rips are automatically fixed in seconds.

Toolkits
--------

> Engineer (specific specialty): Required for performing repairs and installing new equipment.
>
> Forensics: Required for investigating crime scenes and testing samples.
>
> Mechanical: Required for repairs and construction.
>
> Scientific: Required for scientific testing and analysis.
>
> Surveying: Required for planetary surveys or mapping.

Weapons
-------

Weapons are described with the following statistics:

TL
: The lowest Technology Level at which the weapon is available.

Range
: The range modifiers used for that weapon.

Damage
: The damage the weapon inflicts.

Auto
: The Auto rating of the weapon if it is capable of automatic fire.

Recoil
: The Recoil rating of the weapon.

Mass
: The amount, in kilograms, that the weapon weighs on a world with Earth-like gravity.

Magazine
: The number of shots the weapon can take before needing to be reloaded or connected to a new power pack. Unless specified otherwise in the weapon’s description it takes only a single minor action to reload or two to switch to a new power pack.

Cost
: The weapon’s cost in credits.

Ammo Cost/Power Pack
: The cost in credits to buy a spare magazine for a gun or a spare power pack for an energy weapon.

### Melee Weapons

Blade
: A hybrid knife weapon, somewhere between a dagger and a cutlass, with a large basket hilt.

Broadsword
: A heavy two-handed sword.

Cutlass
: The standard shipboard blade weapon, often kept near airlocks to repel boarders.

Rapier
: A character using a rapier increases their effective Melee (large blade) skill by one level when parrying.

Club
: Whether a handy length of metal piping or an extending riot baton made of advanced polymers, the club remains a popular and practical weapon wherever intelligent species gather.

Dagger
: Daggers are especially suited to close-quarters combat - while grappling someone armed with a dagger can do Effect + 4 damage if they choose to hurt their opponent.

Improvised Weapon
: When there’s no real weapon available and your bare hands just aren’t enough, any snatched-up object can be used as an impromptu club.

Shield
: A character using a shield increases their effective Melee (unarmed) skill by one level when parrying. A character with no Melee counts as having Melee 0 when using a shield to parry.

Staff
: A length of wood or metal that can be used in a variety of combat styles, to aid walking, or to poke potentially dangerous things from a distance.

Stunstick
: This melee weapon deals 2d6 stun damage in addition to its normal damage. A character struck by a stun stick must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the stun damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed, the character is knocked unconscious.

### Slug Throwers

Accelerator Rifle
: Also known as gyrojet weapons, accelerator rifles are designed for zero-gravity combat. They fire tiny missiles that leave the rifle with minimal velocity and thus minimal recoil, then accelerate to high speed.

Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR)
: The ultimate evolution of the conventional firearm, advanced combat rifles are the weapon of choice for many military units. Standard equipment includes an electronic battlefield sight, incorporating both light amplification and IR abilities, visual magnification up to 5x zoom, and a laser rangefinder which may also be used as a target painting device (reveals exact distance to target). The weapon is also gyroscopically stabilised during firing.

Antique Pistol
: Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1 DM to attacks. Antique pistols require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug pistol) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again.

Antique Rifle
: Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1 DM to attacks. Antique rifles require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug rifle) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again.

Assault Rifle
: Assault rifles fire lighter projectiles than rifles, but are capable of a higher rate of fire and are more suitable to short-range encounters.

Autopistol
: Variants of this semi-automatic pistol are the standard sidearm for law enforcement officers and criminals.

Autorifle
: Automatic rifles have a higher muzzle velocity and are capable of automatic fire. Also termed battle rifles.

Body Pistol
: Body pistols are manufactured from plastics and cultured bone, making them very difficult to detect using conventional weapons scanners. Body pistols increase the difficulty of Sensors checks to detect them to Very Difficult (-4).

Gauss Rifle
: Gauss rifles replace conventional rifles at TL 13. Like the smaller gauss pistol, rifles fire high-velocity projectiles using electromagnetic rails.

Gauss Pistol
: Gauss pistols use electromagnetic coils to accelerate metallic darts to hypersonic speeds. Gauss weapons are lightweight, efficient and deadly.

Revolver
: A conventional six-shooter handgun. Revolvers take two minor actions to reload.

Rifle
: Reloading a rifle requires two minor actions.

Shotgun
: A shotgun using pellet ammunition ignores Dodge dice modifiers, but Armour gives double protection against pellet attacks. A shotgun can also fire solid slugs, which follow all the normal rules for shooting.

Snub Pistol
: These lightweight, low-recoil weapons were designed for use aboard spacecraft and in zero gravity.

### Energy Weapons

A laser that hits with Effect 6+ will permanently blind its target unless they are wearing some sort of eye protection.

Laser Carbine
: Laser carbines are shorter and lighter than laser rifles, and have a correspondingly shorter range.

Laser Pistol
: The TL 9 pistol is bulky, but effective, with no recoil and a large magazine. At TL 11, advances in battery technology and miniaturisation mean that the pistol is no larger than a conventional firearm, but must still be connected to a battery pack for sustained use.

Laser Rifle
: Laser rifles are highly accurate at long range. They are powered by heavy backpacks, although they have an internal battery that can store enough energy for six shots for mobile sniping.

Plasma Rifle
: TL 16 technology allows the bulky reactor and plasma chamber of the PGMP to be made small enough to fit into a rifle frame. The plasma rifle is a high-power sniper weapon designed to crack Battle Dress. Because of its internal reactor it never runs out of ammunition.

Stunners
: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

### Grenades

Aerosol
: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist six metres in radius that diffusess lasers but does not block normal vision. Any laser attack made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser communications through the mist are completely blocked. The mist dissipates in 1d6 x 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

Frag
: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with distance from the blast:

  ---------- --------
  Distance   Damage
  3 metres   5d6
  6 metres   3d6
  9 metres   1d6
  ---------- --------

Smoke
: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six metres in radius, centred on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes a -2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for laser weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1d6 x 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

Stun
: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armour is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

### Heavy Weapons

Grenade Launcher
: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances.

RAM Grenade Launcher
: Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full auto; unlike other weapons with an Auto score, a RAM grenade launcher cannot fire in burst mode. It takes two minor actions to reload a RAM grenade launcher.

Rocket Launcher
: To counteract the recoil of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards in an explosive backblast. Anyone up to 1.5 metres behind a rocket launcher when it fires takes 3d6 damage from the burning gasses. Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this side-effect as a vehicle is a more stable firing platform than a person. It takes three minor actions to reload a rocket launcher.
: The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the Effect of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage to everything within six metres of the impact point. A rocket that misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1d6) of detonating upon impact with the ground (6 – Effect metres away in a random direction). Otherwise it will miss completely and leave the battlefield without striking anything or detonating.

PGMP
: It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by which a user’s Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls made with it.

FGMP
: It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP (minimum Strength 9) and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGMP is fired will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each firing of an FGMP emits 2d6 x 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the immediate vicinity.

### Explosives

The Explosives skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the Explosives skill check multiplies the damage, with a minimum of x1 damage for an Effect of 0 or 1.

Plastic
: This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favourite of military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across known space.

TDX
: An advanced gravity-polarised explosive, TDX explodes only along the horizontal axis.

Pocket Nuke
: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pocket nuke is actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a grenade launcher.

  ------------- ---- ---------- ------------- ------------
  Weapon        TL   Damage     Radius        Cost (Cr.)
  Plastic       6    3d6        2d6 metres    200
  TDX           12   4d6        4d6 metres    1,000
  Pocket Nuke   12   2d6 x 20   15d6 metres   20,000
  ------------- ---- ---------- ------------- ------------

#### Options

Grenade Launcher (TL 8)
: An underslung RAM grenade launcher can be added to any rifle at the cost of 1,000 Cr. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes four minor actions to reload.

Laser Sight (TL 8)
: Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra +1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed. Cr 100. At TL 10, x-ray lasers and improved display technology removes the tell-tale ‘red dot’ of a vislight laser. Cr 200.

Silencer (TL 8)
: A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with Auto 4 or less, masking the sound produced by firing. (–4 DM to detect.) Cr. 250.

Gyrostabiliser (TL 9)
: Stabilisers can be added to any weapon with recoil, reducing the recoil by one point at the cost of 300 credits.

Secure Weapon (TL 10)
: A secure weapon requires authentication in some fashion (scanning the user’s DNA or iris patterns, entering a password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before it can be fired. Cr. 100.

Intelligent Weapon (TL 11)
: This adds Computer/0 to any weapon. Cr 1,000. The TL 13 upgrade adds Computer/1 to any weapon. Cr 5,000.

Vehicles
--------

All vehicles have the following traits:

TL
: The lowest Technology Level that the vehicle is available at.

Skill
: What skill is used to drive or pilot the vehicle.

Agility
: How easy the vehicle is to drive, expressed as a DM to the pilot’s skill check.

Speed
: The vehicle’s maximum speed.

Crew and Passengers
: How many people the vehicle can carry.

Open/Closed
: If the vehicle is open or closed.

Armour
: How much armour the vehicle has. Damage sustained by a vehicle is reduced by its armour.

Hull/Structure
: The number of hits the vehicle can sustain before being disabled.

Weapons
: What weapons the vehicle has, if any, and what fire arcs they are in.

Air/Raft
: An open-topped vehicle supported by anti-gravity technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit but passengers at that altitude must wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably reliable and flexible vehicles.

Ground Car
: A conventional wheeled automobile.

AFV
: A heavily armoured ATV, known as an Armoured Fighting Vehicle, equipped with a triple laser turret. The lasers use the Gun Combat (energy rifle) skill, do 4d6 damage each using the Ranged (rifle) range modifiers, and one, two or three may be fired at the same target with one attack action.

ATV
: An enclosed, pressurised all-terrain ground vehicle. The vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of built-in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint for a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.

G/Carrier
: A grav carrier is effectively a flying tank, and is the standard fighting vehicle of many military forces. The turret-mounted fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of the TL 15 FGMP and uses the same ‘serious firepower’ rules. Advanced containment systems mean that it does not leak radiation with each shot in the same way as the man-portable version.

Grav Belt
: A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted with artificial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to be recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.

Grav Floater
: A grav floater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a platform upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It cannot achieve any great speed but can, like an air/raft, achieve any altitude up to orbit.

### Options

With the exception of on-board computer, each of these options can only be taken once on a given vehicle.

Autopilot (TL 11)
: an autopilot has a Computer/1 specialised to run Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and specialty. This will be in addition to any other computers installed. An autopilot is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many areas (primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law Level polities may require a slave modification to the autopilot for centralized and/or emergency traffic control. Cr 3,000.

Enclosed
: This modification turns an open vehicle into a closed one. It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and top speed by 10%.

Extended Life Support
: A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle.

Heavy Armour
: Increasing the armour of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to the cost of the vehicle.

High Performance
: A vehicle can be made into a high-performance vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50% more.

On-board Computer
: Adding an on-board computer costs the same as a hand computer.

Sealed
: This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is included in the ATV, AFV and G/Carrier). The vehicle can be sealed and provides life support for its passengers and crew for two hours per person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle.

Style
: Allows a vehicle to be customised to the buyer’s wishes. Costs Cr 200 to Cr 2,000.
